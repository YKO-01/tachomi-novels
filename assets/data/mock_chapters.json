        "content": "Lola's POV\n\n\" I, Grayson Dawson, Alpha of the Moonlit pack, reject you, Lola Ashton, as my mate and Luna of this pack,\" I heard Grayson's voice reach my ear and a single tear ran down my left cheek as it felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest.\n\nWhy me? Why am I always on the receiving end of bad things? What have I ever done to deserve this? I wanted to scream and shout at him. I'm his mate, his fated one, and he's rejecting me because I'm the runt of the pack? More tears ran down my cheeks, and I saw him smile at my misfortune.\n\n\"I, Lola Ashton, accept...\" I did not finish my sentence before he held me up by my throat and snarled in my face. His eyes had already changed colors, so I knew his wolf was in charge.\n\n\" You will not reject me, slut. I am your owner, and I tell you what to do and when!\" He slapped me across the face and threw me on the ground.\n\nI struggled to catch my breath, and tears ran down my face freely. I shouldn't have been born. I haven't done anything to deserve this at all.\n\nJasmine howled in pain in my head, and I doubled over in pain, clutching at my chest. I just want this to be over and done with. Maybe when I die, all this pain will go.\n\nI heard mocking laughter above my head and looked up only to see Freya. Freya is the daughter of the current Beta and soon-to-be Luna. She's everything I am not—beautiful blue eyes with shiny blonde hair, killer body, glowing skin, strong, and extremely wicked.\n\nShe stood there with her minions, looking at me with...pity? I couldn't quite place what that emotion in her eye was. She laughed all of a sudden and kicked me in the stomach. She pulled my hair and slapped me, making me fall back on the floor.\n\n\"You actually thought you could be Luna? That Grayson will pick you over me? You're just a worthless bitch that nobody will love. You bring bad luck and misfortune to people around you. You're a whore that will die alone because no one wants to be with you,\" she spat in my face and kicked me in the ribs with her heels.\n\nI could not say anything because it would be deemed rude, which would worsen my punishment. Her minions held me up as she slapped me repeatedly and punched me in the stomach.\n\nShe laughed maniacally as I screamed out in pain, and tears ran down my cheeks. When she was done with me, she threw me on the ground, making me hit my head in the process.\n\nJasmine was quiet in my head; she's always trying to take all of my pains away, but the abuses never stop. We've hoped for 8 years that we'd finally find our mate, our one true love bestowed upon us by the Moon goddess, and they will love us unconditionally; that's what mates do. We really hoped we'd be free from this slavery, constant mockery, and abuse, but all that has gone down the drain now.\n\nAll these sufferings started 8 years ago when my parents, the then Alpha and Luna of the Moonlit pack, died in a rogue incident, and the blame was placed on me. I was just 10. I did not know what really happened; one moment, I was chatting happily with Mom and Dad, and they were gone before I could blink my eye.\n\nThe pack blamed me and stripped me of my Alpha powers; they could not allow a traitor to rule them. Even now, I still don't know what I did wrong or what went wrong. I just had to bear the brunt of it all because the current Alpha, who was my father's Beta, said so.\n\nI was demoted to an omega, the lowest rank for any wolf - the biggest insult to any wolf of high ranking. I became the slave of the pack at a young age. All the people who were nice to me became my enemies and treated me like trash.\n\n\"Jasmine, I'm so sorry for putting us through all of this; if only I wasn't so weak, if only I could stand up for us. I know you've always wanted your mate. I'm so sorry, Jas,\" I cried through our mindlink.\n\n\"None of this is your fault, Lola, I'm sorry for not being able to protect you more. If only I could shift and take all your pain away,\" Jasmine whimpered in my head sadly.\n\nNobody has ever seen Jasmine, I've only ever met her once myself and that was before Mom and Dad passed away. She's a pure white wolf with golden eyes. She's a very pretty wolf, but Mom and Dad said I have to keep her hidden. They never told me why.\n\nI knew I was special. Mom always called me 'her special little wolf'. Others got their wolf at age 16. Alphas got theirs at age 14, but I've had Jas since I was 8. Besides, I've never seen anyone with a pure white wolf and golden eyes.\n\nEveryone thought I didn't have a wolf and looked down on me because of it. We've not been able to shift even if we wanted to because we don't have the energy for that. There's barely enough to eat, and the beatings we get each day are enough to weaken any wolf. I'm surprised I still have Jasmine with me.\n\nI suddenly felt fire in my lower stomach and cried out painfully. People were passing, but no one paid me any attention. Nobody cared if I died; they actually wanted me dead.\n\nJasmine howled in pain in my head as the pain ran wildly through every vein in my body, and I knew Grayson was already getting it on with Freya. This is why he did not allow me to reject him; he knew I was going to be in pain if he was with another woman besides me, and fresh tears started pouring down my cheeks.\n\nI weakly stood up and went towards my room in the cold basement. The pain did not stop; it only got worse. I could barely see where I was going and tripped twice. I wanted to curl up and die; it felt like lava was running through my veins, and I removed all my clothes and lay on the stone bed that I always sleep on.\n\nThe pain gradually subsided, and Jasmine went silent in my head. She was sad, and I was very sad, too. I just wanted to be special to someone; I didn't want a lot.\n\nI knew I had to escape this hellhole somehow. I had been bearing it because of the thought of a mate, but now that there's nothing here for me, I had to leave.\n\nGrayson and Freya's coronation as the new Alpha and Luna is tomorrow evening. I have to leave. Jasmine and I deserve better, and I need to give it to her.\n\n\"Hang in there, Jasmine. I'll get us out of here as soon as possible, I promise,\" I said to Jasmine and heard her lowly whining in acknowledgement of my words as I drifted off to sleep.",

        "content": "Lola's POV\n\nI was startled awake when I felt water on my body; I was still processing where the water could have come from when I felt stinging pain across my cheeks. I opened my eyes and saw Aaron, Grayson's best friend, standing over me with a bucket in his hand. He must have dumped the bucket of water on my head.\n\n\"Get up bitch!\" He barked at me, making me stand up quickly, almost tripping on my feet. I remembered stripping myself of all my clothes the night before and rushed to cover my body, earning myself another slap on the cheek. I fell down, hitting my head on my stone bed. I felt sticky liquid trickling down my forehead and lowly hissed in pain.\n\n\"You think because you're Gray's mate, you'd be treated differently? You're just a stupid nobody who will never be recognized. Freya is our Luna. You're just a wretched bitch that will die lonely,\" he said to me mockingly and kicked me repeatedly.\n\nI'm sure my body has fresh bruises; the ones that were there are still taking time to heal. I have to get Jas and me out of here; I'd die at this rate if I refused to do something.\n\n\"You have a lot to do today. We're crowning our new Alpha and Luna today, and everything has to be fully prepared for that,\" he barked at me. I nodded my head meekly while looking at the floor.\n\nHe held my chin roughly and made me look him in the eye, \"You should be grateful I came to get you and not Grayson. You were trying to seduce whoever came to get you? Nobody will want you; your body is not even attractive. You'd be good to relieve stress, though, pathetic little bitch,\" he spoke as he groped me.\n\nI felt disgusted and wanted to crawl out of my skin as he touched me. Tears poured down my face, but I dared not talk back or refuse, or I'd be in more trouble.\n\n\"Be out in 5 minutes, bitch, or there will be consequences,\" he barked at me and left me after slapping me one more time.\n\nThe torture and pain never stop. We all used to be friends, but then they suddenly turned on me. I wish it would stop; I haven't done anything wrong.\n\nI knew I had to get up before the punishment got worse. I always get up early. I must have been so drained from what happened yesterday. I got up, went to the basin at the corner of my room, washed my face, and wore my dirty gown like that.\n\nI packed my once platinum blonde hair that's now dirty brown due to the dirt that has accumulated in it. I've never enjoyed basic amenities since I became an omega: no new clothes, I only take my bath once a week, and I barely have enough water to wash my hair or even look remotely good. I only eat leftovers from the pack; sometimes, I'm not even allowed to eat. This is not a life I'd wish on anyone. Even the poorest in the pack don't live like this.\n\nI limped to the kitchen, doing my best to avoid pack members to avoid any additional punishment or insult that morning. As my luck would have it, I met the current Luna, Grayson's mom, and Freya in the kitchen, discussing clothes and fashion.\n\nImmediately after I entered the pack kitchen, Luna Natalie sprung on me and barked out orders. Freya looked like she was enjoying my pain as Luna listed out what I was supposed to do before her son's coronation tonight.\n\nI nodded my head, and she left the kitchen with Freya behind her, not before she \"accidentally\" spilled the drink she was having before I came in and broke the the glass, leaving it for me to clean.\n\nI sighed in relief as they both left without touching me. They must be in a good mood today. I rushed to wash the plates used by the pack members that morning. My stomach grumbled as I thought about food. I had not eaten anything since yesterday afternoon, and I probably won't be getting food until evening. I sighed and carried on with my job.\n\nThe pack's ballroom was next. I had to make it squeaky clean or get a beating from Luna Natalie. I got to work cleaning it and was done by noon. I had to clean the whole pack house, too, and could barely stand by the time I was done. I hate my life.\n\nI haven't heard from Jasmine all day. She was probably still recovering from yesterday night. The wolf feels it most when their partner has sex with another she-wolf. I felt so sad for her, and that only fueled my determination to break free from this cruel pack that had deemed me worthless.\n\nHearing voices, I snapped out of my thoughts and tried to make myself small on instinct. It was probably time for lunch, and my stomach grumbled again, even though I knew I wouldn't be getting any food until nighttime. I felt him before I saw him and went still as I felt him move closer to me. I dare not look up at him if I do not want more problems for myself.\n\nHe lifted my chin and looked into my eyes. He smirked evilly at me, and I felt my ears ringing before I could even process what was going on. He slapped me. I did not even do anything wrong, and he slapped me; I heard people around me laughing mockingly.\n\n\"You dare to be in the same room as me and look me in the eye, slut? What have I told you about disrespect and the consequences that come with it?\" he growled at me angrily and gripped my chin to the point that it started hurting.\n\nTears streamed down my face, and Jasmine whimpered lowly in my head; her mate was hurting her, and she could not even communicate with his wolf side because she had to stay hidden for our safety. She receded to the back of my mind, leaving me to face this monster alone. I guess I'm on my own now.\n\n\"I need to teach you a lesson that will permanently put you in your place, a lesson I should have taught you sooner. You'd be ready for me tonight; I'd take you however I want, and you'll take it like the whore that you are. Make sure you clean up nice after my coronation tonight. I'll deal with you, and others can have their turn,\" he said, and loud cheers went off in the room.\n\nI could not believe my ears. He was going to ra*e me. He was going to ra*e me; they're horrible people, but no one ever dared to take my innocence. I've lost everything. I can't lose the only dignity I have left.\n\nI felt disgusted and wanted to puke out my insides. How can anyone be so vile and cruel? He said he wanted to ra*e me, and everyone cheered him on? Freya was in the room when he said it, and she had no problems with that. Just great.\n\nHe said right after their coronation. I need to get as far away from here as I can. I can't go on like this. This pack is fucked up, and I refuse to live like this anymore. I'd rather go rogue than live in a pack that has no mercy for those who were once a part of them.\n\nThey shortly left, and I fell to the ground; I was still in shock at what I saw and heard. He was going to break me completely and then give me to his friends to humiliate. I won't wait for such to happen.\n\nI'll protect you, Jas. I'll protect us. I'll not let anybody taint you. I'd rather die running, were my thoughts as I finally found the strength to leave my position on the floor and made my way to the basement.\n\nTonight. I have to leave tonight!",

        "content": "Lola's POV\n\nTonight. I have to leave tonight.\n\nI sat down on my stone bed, thinking about my life so far. Jasmine has been holding on for too long. I can't let her go through this anymore.\n\nI used to be almost everyone's favorite in the pack until Mom and Dad passed. I don't know what came over Aunt Natalie and Uncle Andrew, Grayson's mom and dad. It's like they've been waiting for the opportunity to make me worthless. They used to be very nice until they were not.\n\nPeople who were not in the pack before that incident did not know I was the daughter of the last Alpha and Luna. Everybody in the wolf world thought I was dead; at least, that's what I heard.\n\nI can't get ra*ed; I can't get my innocence taken away from me, and by that vile bastard nonetheless. I have to come up with a plan; I don't care if I die running; I have to leave this fucked up pack before I am humiliated.\n\nI have to eat this afternoon, I'll need the energy if I'm going to be running. That bastard is definitely going to send people after me, so I have to be in my wolf form.\n\n\"Jasmine, you there?\" I mindlinked Jas and she whimpered in response in my head. \"I'll need you tonight, girl. I'll need you if I'm ever going to make it out alive. I can't let him do this to me, to us. We have to fight our way out of this bondage. We waited because we thought we might find love but it's over now, Jas. We need to run,\" I said pleadingly to Jasmine.\n\n\"I don't know if I can do it for us, Lola. What if we get killed on sight because of my fur color? What if he catches up to us? What if we don't make it alive? I'm so weak, and I've only ever shifted once. I don't want to let you down. Lola.\" Jasmine said weakly in my head, and fresh tears ran down my cheeks. We don't deserve any of this.\n\n\"Jas, we need to try, girl. There's a full moon out tonight. I heard we get stronger when there's a full moon. Maybe that will give us strength to propel forward, but we can't stay here tonight. We might find help in another pack. Anything but here, Jasmine,\" I said to her.\n\n\"You're right. We've been taking this for too long. It's time we break free and start over. We run tonight,\" Jasmine said in my head with new-found determination.\n\nHer words made me see rays of hope. I stood up and made my way to the pack kitchen to see if there was any food I could make do with until evening. I needed to eat to at least get enough energy to run.\n\nI went to the kitchen, and there were slaves running around cooking up a feast for Freya and Grayson's coronation. I was disappointed and was about to leave when I spotted Jane. Jane is an elderly woman who used to be our head cook. She's the only one in the pack who doesn't treat me like I'm beneath her. She can't be nice to me publicly, though, or she'd be punished.\n\nShe saw me as I was about to leave, too, and came to meet me in the hallway. She hugged me with tears in her eyes, and I hugged her back, too. She has always been like a grandmother to me.\n\nShe pulled me towards a dark corner in the hallway, where she broke down in tears, seeing my state. She's not been to the pack in a while; I guess she quit her job, but why was she back tonight? I saw her mouth moving and tried to listen to her over her thoughts.\n\n\"...heard he rejected you and chose Freya anyway. I'm so sorry, Lola. No one deserves to be treated like that by their mate,\" she whispered with tears running down her cheeks, and I hugged her again.\n\n\"You look malnourished, child. Do they ever feed you? I'm sorry I left without telling you. I had to go see my daughter in another pack. She gave birth to her first child, and I went to see her,\" she told me while looking me over. My stomach chose that moment to grumble again. I looked down in embarrassment.\n\n\"Have you had anything to eat today, child?\"\n\nI shook my head negatively, and she told me she'd be back for me. As she left, I tried to make myself small and invisible to anyone passing. I can't take any more beating and assault today; I need to be somewhat okay for me to be able to escape.\n\nJane soon came back with a paper bag in her hand. She gave it to me and hugged me tightly after telling me to live well. It was almost like she knew I was going away. I thanked her and left for the basement again.\n\nI could not eat a lot. It was almost like my body was used to not being fed and rejected the food. I sighed as I kept the paper bag. I could not let anyone find it, or I'd be punished.\n\nI was waiting for night to fall and the coronation to start while praying to the moon goddess to give me the energy and luck to escape this vile land that has done nothing but cause me pain.\n\nI shook in my seat when I heard footsteps coming down the basement. I looked up and saw one of the pack guards and slightly relaxed. They're not as bad as the high-ranking wolves.\n\n\"It's time for the coronation, and Alpha Grayson requires you to be near the ballroom,\" his deep voice boomed, making me jump in my seat, and I nodded my head. He turned to leave, and I followed after him. I don't want to incur wrath on myself.\n\nI followed him to where the coronation was taking place. It looked beautiful and magnificent. Beautiful flowers were used to create an arch in the doorway and were also scattered across the room. People dressed in white. Women in elegant gowns and men in fitted suits were scattered around the room chatting.\n\nI stood out in my dirty attire and unkempt appearance. I knew Grayson brought me there to humiliate me and show me that I'd never be his Luna because I was below him. People gave me dirty glances, and some even cursed me out, but I kept my head down the whole time. I stood to a side in the ballroom and made myself small.\n\nThe chatters in the room suddenly quieted down, and I looked up to see Grayson in a black suit that was perfectly tailored to suit him and Freya in a blood-red gown with thigh-high slit that accentuated all of her curves.\n\nShe looked so good with her hair in waves that she let down to frame her beautiful face. Her make-up looked minimal, and I could not even deny the fact that she looked stunning. Together, they looked amazing and Jasmine howled in pain in my head seeing her mate with another she-wolf.\n\nThey made their way to the stage, and people started clapping, focusing all of their attention on them. Grayson made eye contact with me and smirked evilly. That gesture made me sick to my stomach because I knew what awaited me if I didn't escape before the coronation ended.\n\nEverybody focused their attention on their future rulers, and I took that opportunity to sneak out of the ballroom and out of the pack house. The moon was high up in the sky and shone brightly, almost like the Moon goddess was making way for me.\n\nI made my way to the end of the pack, avoiding patrols and guards. Security is not as tight at the pack boundary, so I thanked the Moon goddess. Right before I morphed into my wolf, I said the words I should have said since the moment I knew he wasn't going to choose me.\n\nUsing my original title, I said those words.\n\n\"I, Lola Ashton, the daughter of Alpha Ryan and Luna Lilian of the Moonlit pack, accept the rejection of Grayson Dawson, the son of Beta Andrew and Female Beta Natalie, as his mate and chosen one,\" I said and felt a surge of power through me at the same time I heard a wolf howling in pain in distant.\n\nJasmine took over my body, and I was a pure white wolf. I felt a new burst of energy coursing through my veins. Then I ran. I ran with everything in me and never looked back.",

        "content": "Lola's POV\n\nThen I ran.\n\nI ran past the pack boundary, feeling the barely there bond I had with the pack break within me, and I felt free. Jasmine howled in happiness as her paws hit the ground, and she charged forward at full speed.\n\nI heard distant howling and knew Grayson had sent his men after me. Jasmine charged on wildly, feeling the wind in her fur; I'm sure she's not even bothered about the fact that warriors could have been sent after us. She'd never felt such freedom before and was just basking in it.\n\nWe were on unclaimed lands, which means rogues could be around. I've heard about rogues even though I don't know what they looked like. Memories from when Mom and Dad died seemed to have vanished, but I do know rogues are dangerous wolves who have lost their touch with their human sides. They're said to look wild, have red eyes, and will kill anything in their sight.\n\nI heard howls get closer and knew we had company. Grayson must be so desperate to have sent men after me. I don't even mean anything to him. He shouldn't have bothered himself with things as trivial as me.\n\nJasmine did not falter for once or show any signs of weakness as she charged on, dodging branches and jumping over trees. I know we had to lose the wolf on our tail, and also, no one could find out about us, so we had to conceal our fur color.\n\nWe passed muddy water, and Jasmine rolled in it, making our fur brown and dirty. I knew that was not enough to mask our scent, but it sure helped conceal our color.\n\n\"Jas, we can't get caught now. We need to mask our scent so we can buy enough time to get us into another pack,\" I said to her through our mindlink.\n\n\"I know, Lola. We have to find a lake or large body of water and drench ourselves in it or find a pile of waste to mask our scent. I don't know how far we have to go till we reach a pack that we can crash in,\" she said, not once stopping to catch her breath.\n\nWe saw a lake ahead and dived into it. It was freezing, and I felt at home even though I wasn't in human form. Jasmine growled lowly and slowly laid down in the part of the water that wasn't too deep but deep enough to conceal us if anybody passed by.\n\nWe saw about five wolves come into view and stayed as still as we could. I prayed to the moon goddess that I'd not be discovered. I don't know what will be done to me if I go back, and I never want to find out. I'd rather die out here alone than go back to that evil, fucked up pack.\n\nI felt one of the wolves sniff the air around us, and Jasmine held her breath. The wolf came up with nothing and they lurked around for a while before they turned back the way they came.\n\nWe waited a while before leaving the lake and running into the forest as far as our limbs would take us. We ran into the early morning before stopping by a tree to catch our breath.\n\n\"Jasmine, let me shift back so you can rest a bit before we continue,\" I said through the mindlink. She looked tired, and our limbs were already brown from running all night.\n\n\"I can't allow you to shift back, human. We did not bring a change of clothes, and it's so cold out here. We need to stay in this form to conserve energy and body heat,\" she said, and I had to agree with her.\n\nWe did not think this through. We just wanted to escape without knowing where to go or how to go about it. I did not know our pack was so far from other packs as I've never been outside that pack for 8 years.\n\nJasmine saw a rabbit and killed it. She ate part of it and left the remaining beside her as we drifted off to sleep. The sun was high up by this time. I hope we won't be captured in our sleep, was my thought as Jasmine rested her head on her forelimbs and closed her eyes.\n\nWe woke up when the sun had almost set and began running again. We needed to find a pack that would take us in; we did not escape Grayson just to live in this place forever.\n\nWe continued this way for two days, sleeping when the sun was up and running when the sun went down. We have been in wolf form since we left the Moonlit pack. Our speed has reduced drastically, and our fur is already brown from sleeping on the forest floor.\n\nOn the third day, rain started falling, and we could not stop to sleep. Jasmine was about to lay down under a big shaded tree when a smell filled our nose. It smelled like a dead rat but ten times worse. Jasmine rolled in the muddy floor to really conceal our fur colour, seeing as we had company.\n\nThrough the heavy rain, we saw glowing red eyes. Rogue. The wolf looked wild and feral, and the rotten smell came from it despite the heavy rainfall.\n\nIt snarled at us, and our survival instincts kicked in, making us growl back too. The wolf eyed us hungrily, and we snapped at him, daring him to come closer.\n\nHe growled loudly and charged at us, trying to get ahold of our neck. She instinctively moved to the side and the rogue wolf missed. This seemed to annoy him, and he made a move to snap at our left hindlimb. We did not see that coming, and he bit a chunk off our hindlimb. We howled in pain and limped to the side when the wolf tried to attack us again.\n\nWe instinctively slashed at his chest, and he fell backward. We started circling each other, and the rogue moved to bite the left side of our stomach. He grabbed us unexpectedly and bit off a bit of our stomach, making blood stain our fur.\n\nSuddenly, a surge of electricity ran through us, and the rogue was thrown back, hitting his back on a tree. He charged towards us again, and we moved to the right, biting into his neck when he came close enough. He struggled to release himself, but we held him down, making blood spill everywhere, including our fur.\n\nWe dropped him to the ground and stood on top of him, clawing at him blindly, making him howl out in pain. Right before his life ended, his eyes shone with something I could not quite place. I think it was fear, and I wondered what he saw in our eyes that made him afraid.\n\nOnce he was dead, I ran. I ran until I came across a claimed territory. I ran into the land and heard howls around me. They thought I was a rogue. I ran into the middle of the pack and felt myself surrounded by big wolves.\n\nThey snarled at me, and I snarled back. I'm not going to get treated like trash again. I'm not going to be imprisoned again. I was about to attack one of them when I felt a needle in my side; I got dizzy and fell to the ground, changing into my human form. Naked.\n\n\"Take her to the dungeon and await the Alpha's order,\" I heard as I was picked off the ground by rough hands.\n\nI thought I had escaped this. I was going to really die now, were my thoughts as I lost consciousness.",

        "content": "Adrian's POV\n\nI sat down dejectedly in the back of the car as Thomas, one of the pack warriors I took with me, drove back to the pack. Another search for my mate in other packs proved futile. I have been doing this for two years now, and all have been abortive.\n\nWhat I want the most in this life is my mate, someone I can love and cherish and call my own. Someone who will rule my kingdom alongside me and bear my pups when the time is right. My own Queen.\n\nI see my parents in love every day, and I wish I could have that for myself. My Dad loves my Mom so much, and the same goes for her, too. They have the kind of love I wish I'd always get, but I haven't found my mate.\n\nI have been going around packs under the guise of checking up on them, but my motive is to find my mate. A mate has been chosen for me, but I don't want to live like that. I will be crowned the Alpha King soon, and I need my Luna beside me to get that title.\n\nThis is my last trip to find my mate. I've gone to every pack, and still nothing. My heart felt heavy, and I cursed out the moon goddess as I made my way back to the pack.\n\nA mate has been chosen for me. In case I do not find my mate, she'd be crowned Alpha Queen alongside me. I did not like that idea, but Dad said it was for my own good—to prevent Alphas from rebelling against me. I guess I have to put my people before my desires.\n\nWe got to the pack house, and I was welcomed by my Mom; at 43, she looked nothing over 25. Damn werewolf gene. I took after her facially but had my Dad's physique. She came running out of our home and peered into the car excitedly. Her face dropped in sadness when she met it empty.\n\nI shook my head negatively as she looked at me, and she came to hug me. She held my hand as she led me into the house. We met my Dad in the kitchen area with a newspaper in his hand, and he looked up as we entered. He saw that I came back empty-handed and came to hug me sympathetically.\n\nMy parents have always supported me in whatever I did; I'm not even mad at them for choosing a mate for me; they're only doing what's best for me.\n\nI excused myself and went into my room. Daxon sighed sadly in my head, and I felt so sad for him. I want my mate, too, but it's harder for him as my wolf side to be without his true mate.\n\n\"We tried our best, Daxon. Maybe the Moon goddess doesn't have a partner for us, or maybe she's dead. We've searched every pack and come up with nothing. I am the next Alpha King. I need to consider my people before my own needs now,\" I said to him through our mindlink, and he receded to the back of my mind, not even replying to me.\n\nI was about to undress when I felt my best friend and next Beta, Nathan, trying to reach me through the pack's mindlink. I put down my barrier and heard his voice.\n\n\"Yo man, you're back already. Did you find her?\" he asked me excitedly. Everyone has been waiting for their next Luna since I turned 14, so I get why he's so excited.\n\n\"Nah, bro. I did not find her. I guess the Moon goddess doesn't have a mate for me,\" I laughed dryly through the mindlink and heard him sigh.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, man. Actually, I mindlinked you to tell you we found a rogue on pack lands earlier today. Dylan told the men to take her to the dungeon. We were waiting for you to come back to decide what to do with her,\" Nathan said through the mindlink.\n\n\"Rogue? A female rogue? We haven't had any rogue attacks since forever. What were the patrol wolves doing when she came into the pack lands? Did she hurt anybody? And why is she still alive, Nathan?\" I said with anger.\n\nWe haven't had a rogue attack for 8 years now. The last one took something precious from me, and I hate rogues with passion. They're vile, dirty creatures that do not deserve any sympathy from anyone.\n\n\"Man, she looked so weak and afraid. It was like she was running from something. She wasn't feral; she was afraid. And she turned back into her human form once she was tranquilized. Besides, it was early in the morning, and the men on patrol were few.\" Nathan tried to make me see reason, but I wasn't having any of it.\n\n\"I don't care, Nathan. Rogues are dangerous creatures and should be killed on sight. I don't want her near my pack members. Kill her, Nathan,\" I said angrily through the mindlink and put up my barrier.\n\nAs I removed my shirt, I heard Fay, my chosen mate, come in. Fay is beautiful and loved by everyone, but she's not my mate. Daxon and I do not feel anything for her. We want a mate!\n\n\"You're back, Adrian. I heard you did not find your mate,\" she whispered in my ear in what she thought was sexy, and I felt disgusted.\n\n\"Get your hands off me and get out of my room, Fay!\" I growled out in my Alpha voice, and she scurried out of my room. I did not want to be mated with someone other than my mate. I want to feel everything Mom and Dad have.\n\nI was done bathing and about to get some shut-eye when Mom came barging into my room, looking angry. Uh oh. I don't know what I did, but Mom can be pretty scary when she's mad.\n\n\"I did not train you to be like this, Adrian Lucas Woods!\" Mom said angrily, and I knew I was in trouble because she used my full name.\n\n\"I did not do anything, Mom. I just got back from my trip, and I came to my room; I haven't done anything, I promise.\" I looked at her, thinking about what I could have done wrong. Was it because I told Fay to get out? Mom doesn't even like her like that. She just agreed because she's the best option for me.\n\n\"That's exactly what you did! You did not do anything! A rogue was caught on the pack lands after 8 years, and you were not going to find out what brought her into our land? You're the next Alpha King, Adrian. You can't take things lightly like this. What if there are more of them, and she's a spy? What if we can get more information out of her, and you gave orders that she should be killed?\" Mom exclaimed angrily and marched out of my room.\n\nI sighed and mindlinked Nathan that I'll be at the dungeon in half an hour and nothing must be done to the rogue. I dressed up and went downstairs to get something to eat. I'll need the energy to deal with that motherfucking intruder.\n\nI left the pack house and felt Daxon get restless in my head. He's never restless, and that got me worried.\n\n\"What's it, buddy? Is something wrong?\" I asked through our mindlink.\n\n\"I don't know. I have the feeling that something is about to happen at the dungeon, but I can't place what it's going to be,\" Daxon replied.\n\nI quickened my pace to the dungeon. I hope I don't shed blood today. I'm unstoppable once I start. Another reason I need my mate. Fuck you, Moon goddess.",

I kept thinking as more tears poured down my cheeks.\n\nI was happy that Grayson was out of the picture, but the look I saw in Adrian's eyes when I entered broke me. He wanted me to be at fault; he wanted me to be the bad person so he could have a good reason to throw me out of the pack.\n\nI was crying so much that it was hard to breathe. I knew Jasmine was having it worse because she's been silent since Adrian stormed out of the room.\n\n\"Jasmine, I'm sorry I put us through this. If only I hadn't been born, if only I hadn't been so weak, we'd not have to go through this pain and rejection,\" I said to her tearily, and I could almost feel her shake her wolfish head.\n\n\"Lola, it is not your fault that they can't look past the exterior and see that you're someone worth fighting for.

Why are you pretending to be asleep?\" She asked. Damn werewolf hearing.\n\n\"I'm still asleep; I don't know what you're talking about,\" I said with my face buried in the pillow, and she laughed before sitting up in bed.\n\n\"I see you're still really asleep.

        "content": "Elisabeth’s POV\n\n“Aah, yes! Harder! Harder, Gabe! I’m almost there! Oh yes!” I moaned loudly, arching my spine and throwing my head back.\n\nWas it true? Far from it. I had already spit in my hand and rubbed it between my legs twice so he would think I was still soaking wet for him.\n\n“I’m coming, Gabe! Harder!”\n\nI breathed out my moans and slightly turned them up a notch—not screaming, but almost. A slight trembling in my thighs, dragging my nails up his back, and squeezing his dick a couple of times while he was pounding me like a dog in heat would get him there faster.\n\nI should get a fucking Oscar!\n\nHis grunting became more carnal, like a dying squirrel, and his hips stiffened.\n\nI tightened the muscles in my pussy yet again while lifting my ass off the bed and releasing my scream. I rolled my eyes back before closing them.\n\nAn Oscar for fucking! That would have been something to show off. I had to hold back the laughter.\n\n“Fuck, baby! You’re so tight!”\n\nHe slumped down on top of me, nearly knocking the air out of my lungs. Warm and sweaty—yuck! He was turning limp inside me and started covering my neck with sloppy, wet kisses. A shiver went through my body, and I grabbed his shoulders, pushing him back slightly.\n\nI just needed the car keys so I could go to work.\n\nI made it just in time. I worked at an old, run-down gas station outside of town—late shifts and night shifts. It was a crappy and tedious job, but at least I got paid, and the old couple running it was super sweet.\n\nThe shift dragged on; a couple of bikers stopped by, and a young couple who seemed to be lost. That’s it.\n\nAt a quarter past midnight, I was finally on my way home. I stared straight ahead at the dark road—no streetlights, no passing traffic, and not even a single house. Driving home in the darkness always made me this way—spaced out. I never had any idea what awaited me at home.\n\nHome.\n\nI scoffed. It was an old dump, but it was the only place my mom could afford to rent, and this time, we had managed to keep it for over six months. Would all my things be scattered outside the house when I got back? It wouldn’t be the first time a landlord had thrown us out because Mom had missed one too many payments.\n\nWould we still have electricity? Was it on fire? Was it filled with drunk, high, and nasty people? Was this the time I came home and found her dead?\n\nI jumped in my seat, and the car swerved sharply. Sweat formed on my temples as I struggled to regain control. The car skidded to the side of the road, and my heart pounded wildly. My grip on the steering wheel was so tight it hurt, but I didn’t notice until I’d finally calmed down enough. My knuckles were white when I finally let go.\n\n“What the fuck was that!?” I shouted at myself. Did I run over an animal? Did I space out so much that I imagined things?\n\nI swallowed hard. Should I go out and check? And then what? Bring an injured animal home? I couldn’t afford to take it to the vet.\n\nGod, I need to calm down! I don’t even know if I hit anything. Maybe I missed it. Or it was just a freaking shadow.\n\nRummaging through my purse, I found my phone. 10%. Great. Just turning the flashlight on caused it to drop to 8%.\n\nThe crisp night air brushed against my face as I set one foot out the door, and my whole body froze. My head snapped to the side, and my heart pounded again, trying to break through my chest.\n\nNothing. There was nothing there.\n\nA branch snapped, and I jumped back in, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me.\n\n“Fuck, fuck, fuck! It’s just an owl,” I murmured, fidgeting with the key. My hands were shaking, and I missed the ignition. The keys fell to the floor, and I dived down after them.\n\nMy imagination was running wild. Suddenly, the gravel crunched—behind the car, at the passenger side, under the car—and I fucking jammed the key in the ignition, pressing the pedal as hard as I could.\n\nGravel and dirt rocketed behind the vehicle before it lurched forward, and I held max speed all the way home. Not once did I look in the mirror, and not once did I slow down.\n\nI’m going home now.\n\nDriving up to the dark house I called home, I finally felt like I could breathe again. The place looked quiet—no cars in the driveway, my things weren’t thrown out on the sidewalk, no loud music, and no one stumbling around puking outside.\n\nThis could be a good night… or the end of everything as I knew it.\n\nThe only sound was the squeaking of the door as it opened. It was so quiet—way too quiet. Mom was usually home by now, but she couldn’t drive, and the last bus had passed half an hour ago. The air was cold, but it still smelled old and stale.\n\nFuck, the power was out again. I flicked the switch a couple of times before giving up. I was so sure I had paid the last bill. I sighed and glanced down at my phone—5%. Great. I need to find somewhere to charge it before I can sleep.\n\nI decided to walk through the house to look for Mom before heading back out. Maybe Gabe was still awake. I could fake another orgasm if it meant sleeping in a warm bed and charging my phone at the same time.\n\nWith the cold light from the moon shining through the windows, I made my way from room to room.\n\nNothing. Nobody.\n\nNot until I reached the bathroom.\n\nI saw her the moment the door slid open—her dark and fragile silhouette against the cold, white floor. I held my breath, not daring to step closer. I waited, but it was impossible to tell if she was breathing or not.\n\n“Mom?” My voice barely escaped, a pathetic whisper.\n\nNothing. Kneeling, I touched her hand. It was ice-cold—but it always was. Suddenly, she groaned and yanked her arm back.\n\nI breathed out in relief, but anger, disappointment, and hatred washed over me as fast as the ease left my lungs.\n\nLike always, I held it in. I bit my lip and started to scoop her up in my arms.\n\nSitting down on the bed beside her, I could see her face in the cold moonlight. The woman I called Mom was no longer my mom. There was nothing left of her—just skin and bones, bruises, and open wounds on her arms, ankles, and between her toes.\n\nHer memories had faded, and her personality had drowned in liquor years ago. The only thing she knew and cared about was her next hit, money, and mumbling shit about my father—a man I never knew or met.\n\nThe only thing I knew of him was what she rambled about when she was about to pass out:\n\n“He is a monster! I saved you. He is a monster! We don’t belong in this world! A monster! A nightmare! I saved you!”",

        "content": "Elisabeth’s POV\n\nSometimes, I doubted it—could things be worse than this? But the only thing that truly hit home was: We don’t belong in this world. Even if it was a total ramble, I never felt like I belonged here. There was never any room for me—or my mom, for that matter.\n\nWe were scum, a disgrace. It didn’t matter that I was a straight-A student and had almost perfect attendance at school. I would always be scum, something that belonged in the gutter.\n\nMom’s skin felt damp and cold against my fingers as I tucked her dry, splintered hair behind her ear.\n\n“In the next life, Mom. In the next life.”\n\nThese were the only words that stuck with me from when I was a child, back when she still had clear days. When we had to go to bed hungry again, the power was out, or my shoes were destroyed and she couldn’t get me new ones, she always cradled me in her arms, brushing away my tears.\n\n“In the next life, baby girl. In the next life.”\n\nMy tummy rumbled, and I cried in hunger. For many years, those words didn’t make sense to me at all. But as time passed, as I saw her slowly disappear in front of my eyes, I understood.\n\nIn the next life.\n\nI closed her door, and with both hands along the wall, I found my way to the stairs in complete darkness. I fumbled my way step by step until my foot finally found the cold wooden floor. A door behind me slammed shut, and I spun around. But all that met me was utter silence and more darkness.\n\n“Mom?”\n\n“Hello?”\n\nNo answer.\n\nHad she brought someone with her? It wouldn’t be the first time. I cursed under my breath and turned back around. The stairs behind me squeaked, and I froze in place, listening closely. There it was again—someone heavy, slowly making their way down the old stairs.\n\n“Hello? Get the fuck out! The party’s over!” I shouted, my hand sliding into my pocket to grab my pepper spray.\n\nStill no answer, but the squeaking sound filled the air again, like the old wood groaning under someone’s weight.\n\n“Get the hell out! Now!”\n\n“Run, rabbit. Run.” The voice came out of nowhere—deep and carnal. The hairs on my arms stood on end, and a chill crept down my spine.\n\nRumbling, hoarse laughter echoed in the darkness. I heard someone shouting after me as I spun around and ran straight out the door, my heart pounding in my chest. I stumbled towards my car.\n\nDon’t look back, don’t look back!\n\nFrantically, I yanked at the car door. Fuck! But I didn’t lock it! Fuck, fuck! My hands trembled as I searched my pockets, but nothing! Where is the key!?\n\nThe front door creaked open behind me, and I kicked the car in frustration, spinning around and bolting for the road.\n\n“Little bunny, little bunny. Wolf is hungry!”\n\nWhat kind of sick bastards are these!? That creepy laughter still echoed behind me, but I wasn’t staying to find out! The thud of my heartbeat pounded through my ears, my breath fast and shallow. Just as the road came into view, a hand grabbed my shoulder, yanking me back harshly.\n\nAdrenaline surged through me. I spun around, fist flying, and landed a solid punch right into some dude’s throat. Goddamn, he’s tall!\n\nHe released me, and the little sadist inside me smiled as I heard him cough and gasp for air behind me. I had aimed for his nose, but crushing his throat would do the trick.\n\nBut my victory was short-lived. The air was knocked out of my lungs, and I was thrown several meters down the road. The pavement scraped my skin raw, and the sounds around me were drowned out by the pounding of my heart. My vision blurred, and just before the darkness took over, I swore I saw a wolf towering above me.\n\nGreat. Just great.\n\nMy eyes rolled back, and darkness devoured me completely.\n\nThe wolves could have me. I didn’t care anymore.\n\nIn the next life, Mom. In the next life.\n\n***\n\nI floated on a comfortable cloud. Birds squeaked around me, the air fresh and light. I took another deep breath, smiling softly as I opened my eyes.\n\nIt wasn’t a cloud. I was being rocked back and forth on a hard wooden floor. No, a wagon. It smelled like shit here! Looking around, I realized I wasn’t alone—but I had never felt lonelier. At least eight girls sat around me, one of them quietly sobbing. The others stared blankly at the wooden floor, their hands and feet bound with thick rope.\n\nThere were no birds. The squeaking was the sound of the old wood and wheels. It was a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nMy side ached, and the skin on my knee stuck to my pants. Great. Torn. They were nearly new! Lifting my knees, I managed to roll into a sitting position.\n\nGreen grass, trees, open sky. Where the heck did they take me? At home, it was always damp, dark, and cold. I hadn’t seen this much greenery since I was a kid.\n\nI shook my head. Not going down that memory lane. Those were tough years, but at least I learned a lot.\n\nThe wheels crunched over uneven gravel, rocking me back and forth. There wasn’t even a real road here! How long was I out?\n\n“Where are we?” I didn’t ask anyone in particular, but nobody answered. None of the girls even lifted their heads to look at me.\n\nFrowning, I studied them closely. Some were dirty, and all had fresh or old tear tracks on their cheeks. The crying girl had small leaves and sticks in her hair—and something that looked like blood on her chin and sweater.\n\nHuman trafficking? Kidnapping?\n\n“Are you all deaf? Where are we!?” I raised my voice, and they all hunched down like they could make themselves smaller than they already were.\n\n“Hush! Shut up! You’ll get us in trouble! We don’t know, okay? Nobody knows! So shut up!” A blonde girl spat the words at me, her intense blue eyes narrowed as she sized me up. Then she huffed and looked away.\n\nNo doubt an upper-class girl—long, cherry-red nails, one even glittering with a small diamond. A golden bracelet, an expensive dress, and heels I could only dream of.\n\nBut none of that could help her now. The swollen red lines around her eyes and smudged makeup trailing down her cheeks said it all. She had cried, just like the rest of them.\n\nI didn’t like this one bit.\n\nYanking at the thick ropes, I twisted my wrists. The rough fibers burned against my skin but moved. Rolling my shoulders, I shuffled my hands up and down. Not that tight.\n\nI wasn’t sticking around to find out what kind of nightmare this was.\n\nLooking over my shoulder, I spotted the backs of two men.\n\nMy eyes widened. They were massive.",

        "content": "Elisabeth’s POV\n\nMuscles bulged all over their bare backs, tattoos twisting and snaking around their shoulders, necks, and probably further down their chests.\n\nOne had a high, messy braid running from his forehead all the way down his neck. The sides of his head were shaved to the skin, with tattoos resembling snakes decorating one side. The other had slightly lighter hair, a darker brown. His sides were also shaved, but his hair was twisted and secured with leather bands that ran down to the middle of his back.\n\nI couldn’t see around them, but I guessed one or two horses were pulling us. It was a slow and steady pace, like the animals were already worn out and tired. We wobbled and jolted a little through a sharp turn, and suddenly, a small town appeared.\n\nNo, not a town! This looked more like a wooden village from an old game or movie. But by the sounds I could hear in the distance—talking, shouting, kids crying, the distinct clash of metal against metal—a lot of people were living there. The whole thing seemed to be surrounded by a massive fence, like they had just cut off the branches of the biggest trees they could find and stuck the trunks together. Primitive but effective.\n\nThis was definitely a new level of crazy. With a little struggle and grunting, I managed to sit up on my knees. Thank God they only tied my hands and not my feet like the others. The blonde kept staring at me to the point where my temper got the best of me.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\nShe just rolled her eyes and looked away again as if she hadn’t been staring at me intensely for over five minutes.\n\nI managed to turn around and push myself back toward the end of the carriage. It had a wooden plank across it, but a 10 cm plank wouldn’t hold me back! I kept my eyes on the men in front, but so far, they seemed too occupied watching the horses’ asses in front of them.\n\n“They will kill you, you know.”\n\nMy head snapped toward the blonde. She was still looking down at me. Yes, I was sitting on the dirty floor, but she was in the same boat as me! No need to be so smug. Money clearly couldn’t help her out of this—not from the looks of it.\n\n“Yeah, but I’d rather die running than be part of whatever sick fantasy these creeps have planned for us! See you on the other side.”\n\nI grinned, and with a push of my feet, I launched myself over the plank. I landed with a heavy thud on the rocky ground, my upper back colliding with the dirt. The air was forced out of my lungs, making me gasp. The pain made my stomach churn.\n\nClenching my teeth, I forced myself upright. As I straightened, I saw the carriage continuing on. The blonde’s wide eyes locked on me in disbelief. I winked at her, turned, and ran as fast as I could toward the edge of the forest.\n\nMy hands were still bound behind my back, but not for long! A sinister smile spread across my lips as I heard shouting and swearing behind me. It didn’t matter—I had already reached the dense forest.\n\nI stopped between the trees and finally managed to yank my hands free. The thick rope burned against my skin, but I coiled it up and shoved it into my pocket. It could come in handy later.\n\n“Fucking cunt!” a deep voice roared.\n\nUnder different circumstances, I would have laughed, but I managed to hold back and just smile at the anger in his voice.\n\n“Don’t kill her! Just bring her back!”\n\nGood, he can’t kill me. That might be useful later, too. I turned and ran, dodging trees, bushes, and massive rocks. Eventually, I’d have to reach the city—or at least a road!\n\nSweat formed on my back and forehead as I pushed through the thick forest. The sun blazed above, making the air feel thick and hard to breathe. It was stiflingly still, not even the slightest breeze reaching through the trees.\n\nMy heart pounded harder, the pulse echoing in my ears. Someone was running not far behind me! I rushed between two trees and stumbled into a clearing. Looking back over my shoulder, I nearly tripped—his eyes were yellow!\n\nI turned back around and felt my stomach drop as I realized where I stood—on the edge of a steep cliff. The grassy field ended abruptly, giving way to loose soil and small rocks tumbling down into the river far below.\n\n“Hey, kitty, kitty! Nowhere to run now.” It was the same deep, carnal voice from the previous night.\n\nMy throat went dry as I hesitantly turned around. Every fiber of my body screamed at me to run—or jump. Whatever it takes!\n\nHe looked even more massive now. Tall, with black braided hair and tattoos twisting over his skin. His muscular arms were crossed over his broad chest, veins bulging down his forearms. Droplets of sweat glistened on his sun-kissed skin, running down his chest.\n\nMy breath caught as his gaze met mine. His eyes were still yellow—freakishly bright yellow. He blinked slowly, and for a moment, they flickered back to a cold, icy blue. He arched a brow at me, unimpressed.\n\nBesides looking like a sweaty god carved from muscle, he seemed like he had walked straight out of a barbarian fantasy novel. The deep V-shape of his torso disappeared into low-hanging, rough-looking pants held up by a thick leather belt. His ankles were wrapped in leather cords, scrunching the pants tight just above his strange footwear.\n\nShoes? No—more like thick leather socks tied around his calves with more leather cords.\n\nDid I just get kidnapped by a group of mentally disturbed cosplayers?\n\nI had to admit, though—those lenses were amazing.\n\nMy gaze drifted back up to his face. God, he looks like the dark version of Jax from Sons of Anarchy. Ice-blue eyes, sharp features, and a beard slightly longer under the chin. Honestly, if it weren’t for the silver rings woven into his beard, I’d do him in a heartbeat—no questions asked.\n\n“You satisfied now?”\n\nMy cheeks burned. I had been staring at him like a snack without even trying to hide it.\n\nInvoluntarily, I took a few steps forward, unable to tear my eyes away. But the ground beneath my feet crumbled, dirt and small rocks tumbling over the cliff’s edge.\n\nHis intense blue eyes never left me. Suddenly, I felt small. My cheeks were still burning, and my heart was hammering against my ribcage. I looked to the side, catching a slight movement in the bushes behind him. But there was nothing there—just the wind.\n\n“You won’t make it, even if you try to crush my throat again.”\n\nMy gaze snapped back to him. So it was him! I searched his neck for a bruise—but nothing. How was that possible? I could clearly remember the coughing and gurgling sounds he had made as I ran.\n\nHis bored sigh pulled me out of my thoughts. I met his gaze without hesitation. This wasn’t a man I wanted to go up against, but I sure as hell wasn’t about to be his hunting toy, either. Rabbit, was it?\n\n“I’m not going back. Whatever that was, and whatever you have going on there—thanks for the ride, but I’m good now. Bye!”\n\n“Oh, so we have a little princess on our hands?”\n\nI scowled, but he only made a theatrical, overly dramatic bow.\n\n“Dear Royal Highness, follow me if you’d like to live.”",

        "content": "Elisabeth’s POV\n\nI laughed, but it was abruptly cut off by the sound of a rumbling growl. Did he just growl at me?\n\nFine. I could play this game too. I gave a theatrical curtsy and replied, “I appreciate the request, but I’m afraid I have to deny it, barbarian. Shoo! Run away now and leave me be!”\n\nAs I straightened up, it felt like he had somehow grown taller. His eyes darkened, and I realized I’d reached the limit.\n\n“Shut up. We’re leaving now! I can carry you, or you can walk! But note this—if you force me to carry you, I’ll make the walk worth my while.”\n\nHis hungry gaze flickered again, his stare raking over me slowly. That deep growl rumbled in his chest once more, almost animalistic.\n\nI took a couple of steps forward, and a flash of disappointment crossed his face, quickly masked by irritation and slight anger. Moron.\n\nThen he licked his lips. And my eyes widened. Canines!\n\nI watched, horrified, as his teeth slowly elongated. Hell. No.\n\n“Fine! Be a drag! Now, come on! I’m wasting my time, and they’re waiting! Put that pretty little ass into motion before I do!”\n\nThey’re waiting? No, thanks. Mentally rolling my eyes, I forced a smile—the sweetest pout I could muster. I looked up at him through my lashes and slowly bit my lip, letting it slide out between my teeth.\n\nI had his full attention now.\n\nSo while his head was thoroughly stuck in the gutter, I spun around and sprinted straight for the edge of the cliff. Just before I reached it, I shouted over my shoulder, “Enjoy the view, perv!”\n\nAnd then I jumped.\n\nThe damp, misty air hit me the moment I leaped. The fall was so much longer than I expected, and even though I jumped on purpose, I couldn’t stop the high-pitched scream that escaped my lips—seconds before I crashed into the wild, ice-cold water below.\n\nEverything was a blur—water, rocks, chaos. I tumbled under the current, lungs burning, desperate for air. The freezing water surged into my eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, relentless and punishing.\n\nAir! I need air!\n\nPanic took over as I thrashed against the current, struggling to find the surface. Darkness began creeping in from the edges of my vision. My body went limp, the fight draining out of me.\n\nJust as I felt consciousness slip away, rough hands grabbed my shoulders.\n\nAnd then—blackness.\n\n***\n\nThe soft crackling of a fire was the first thing I noticed. The warmth spread over me, and I instinctively curled up, clutching the cozy blanket closer. It felt so nice. Comforting.\n\nFireplace?\n\nMy eyes shot open, and I bolted upright so fast I felt dizzy. It took a few seconds to adjust—no longer submerged, no longer drowning. I blinked hard, my head swimming, until my vision settled.\n\nI was sitting on the ground, right beside a burning fire.\n\nI stretched, yawning, and rubbed my eyes. And then—two things happened.\n\nOne: I locked eyes with a man.\n\nTwo: I realized the cold breeze prickling my skin was because my breasts were completely bare.\n\nMy eyes went wide as I yanked the blanket up to cover myself, locking eyes with him again.\n\n“What the hell!?”\n\nHe blinked, unfazed. “No, Luca.”\n\nWas he serious?\n\n“What?!”\n\n“My name is Luca.”\n\nI stared at him, dumbfounded. He looked different from the others—tall, yes—but leaner. Not as massive or testosterone-fueled as the rest. His eyes were a deep, mossy green, sharp but softer than the others. His jawline was sharp, his chin slightly narrow, and his face, well… pretty.\n\nBut it seemed like he made up for the lack of bulk with pure arrogance. He reminded me more of the type that stuck-up blonde would enjoy the company of.\n\n“Why am I naked?”\n\nSudden embarrassment mingled with rising anger. Normally, I didn’t care—nudity was just nudity. But this felt different. I was vulnerable, exposed, and unaware that it had even happened. That wasn’t okay.\n\nI scowled as he let out a dramatic sigh, brushing his long, nearly white hair over his shoulder. His hair… was stunning. Thick, silky, like something from a shampoo commercial. Was he even a real man? Or a model?\n\nFocus!\n\n“What the hell are you doing out here, poking a stick at the fire and stripping unconscious girls?”\n\n“Because you were soaking wet and freezing when I dragged your ass out of the river,” he replied, still annoyingly calm. “You’re welcome, by the way.”\n\nThat shut me up for a second. God, I’m ungrateful. But that didn’t excuse the smug grin spreading across his face.\n\nI exhaled sharply. “Oh. Yeah. I’m… I’m sorry. Thank you.”\n\nHis grin widened into a full, beaming smile, and I felt my heart skip a beat. Damn it, are they all this good-looking?\n\n“See? That wasn’t so hard! You’re welcome. You do have nice breasts, by the way. Can I touch them?”\n\nMy jaw dropped. He said it so casually, like he’d just asked to pet a puppy.\n\n“Wha—NO! What the hell? Where are my clothes!?”\n\n“Why not? I saved you! It’s not fair for you to keep them all to yourself!”\n\n“What the—are you out of your mind? Where does it say ‘save me and get a free boob squeeze’? Give me my clothes!”\n\nHis grin didn’t falter. In fact, he looked even more amused as he tossed something at me. I caught it mid-air and unfolded it.\n\nA dress.\n\nA very short, pale pink dress with enough cleavage to make a professional escort blush.\n\nI threw it back at his face.\n\n“My clothes. Not this napkin!”\n\nHe blinked, frowning down at the garment as though confused. “It’s a dress.”\n\nI folded my arms. “It’s the size of a napkin. Just tell me where my clothes are! This is ridiculous! Look—I’m grateful you saved me, but I don’t appreciate sitting here butt naked! I want my clothes. Please.”\n\nThat word seemed to catch him off guard. His teasing faltered as he fiddled awkwardly with the fabric in his hands.\n\n“I… well… I’m sorry. But those clothes weren’t fit for a young girl like you! This is high quality! It was made by the Elven seamstress herself!”\n\n“Elven… what? Fitting for a girl like me? Who the hell walks around the forest in a skimpy little dress like this? I want my pants, my shirt, my bra, and my sweater—now!”\n\n“I burned them.”\n\nI blinked. “You… did what? Why!?”\n\nHe crossed his arms. “You know as well as I do! Those clothes were not fit for a young girl at her best age! They hid all your curves, your breasts, your hips—all the good and juicy parts! This—” he shook the dress “—is perfect! If you wear this, you’ll probably get a mate mark too!”\n\nMy brain short-circuited. “What the hell are you talking about? And why the fuck would I want to show off my juicy parts? You need to get me some pants—now! Those were my favorite jeans! And my bra! What the hell was wrong with my bra!?”\n\n“I have your bra… just not those ugly pants or sweater.”\n\n“Those cost me a small fortune! Give me my bra, and I’ll get out of here!”\n\nHe jumped up, visibly flustered. “I’ll get you better pants! But you can’t leave! The wolves are still looking for you!”\n\nWolves? Did he just say wolves?\n\nHe bolted into the darkness, leaving me alone by the fire. I shuffled closer to the flames, wrapping the blanket tighter and scanning the shadows around me.",

        "content": "Elisabeth’s POV\n\nThis is leather! Thick, brown leather pants! And they have to be at least three sizes too big! The pants Luca came back with look massive; I know I should not complain, but he did ruin my pants! And this is supposed to be better? It felt heavy in my hands, and the dark brown fabric looked thick and uncomfortable.\n\n“Just put them on! It’s from my mate’s stash, so you should be grateful! Gawd, I’m beginning to think you’ve never seen any of the work from the seamstress!”\n\n“Mate stash? That sounds so weird! And no, no, I have not, okay!?”\n\n“Fine, just put them on. It will work.”\n\nI gasped. Just as I zipped them tight, they suctioned in and became so tight! Like they were painted on, and I struggled even to move!\n\n“What the…”\n\n“Good, now squat down a couple of times. Oh, good god, don’t give me that look! Just fucking do it!”\n\n“Stop yelling!”\n\nI felt so stupid squatting down, and I was so sure they would tear and bare my ass. Fuck, how did I end up in all this? But to my surprise, as I squatted down, the pants seemed lighter, like they fitted perfectly—firm but soft against my skin. Not one single place on my body was too tight or too loose. What is this? Why haven’t I heard of these before?\n\n“See! Told you!”\n\nI could not help smiling back at his smug, beaming face.\n\n“Oh my god! These are incredible!”\n\n“I know; as I said, they cost me a fortune! They will custom-fit whoever wears them first. Better now? Lift your knees a couple of times, too. Every part of it needs to move around you and find your shapes.”\n\nThis time, I did just as he said, lifting my knees one by one. The fabric that usually scrunches up behind your knees dissipated, and I never thought I could be so excited about pants!\n\n“Great, now bend over.”\n\nAnd as the obedient little idiot I am, I did. Touching my toes, so excited. These are like magic! But I quickly got up and glared at him, suddenly very aware of how I just bent over and showed my ass in his face.\n\n“Oh yes! Just like that! God, they fit nicely.”\n\nHe groaned behind me, and just as I turned, I saw him adjust his dick in his pants. So, I made the mistake of forgetting I was dealing with a little perv!\n\n“Pervert! Don’t you have any filters at all? That right there!? That’s just disgusting!”\n\n“Why would I? How would you know I wanted you if I didn’t tell you? I think you should choose me as your mate! I do have other clothes from the same place, you know!”\n\nWith a grimace, I just stared back at him for a couple of seconds; there was that word again.\n\nMate.\n\nWhy couldn’t he just say friends like a normal person? And why the hell did I have to end up being saved by the one person who doesn’t think before he speaks, literally eating me up with his eyes and totally shameless?\n\nI sighed; I guess men are the same, no matter what part of the world you’re in. Horny pigs, but I can deal with that.\n\n“Sure, we can be friends. But you've got to tone down that creepy attitude! No girl would fall for that! Just makes you sound like a fuckboy…”\n\nHe laughed, threw his arm over my shoulders, and guided me back to the fireplace.\n\nOh god, what’s wrong with me? He is an ass, but I don’t think I have even seen someone this pretty! His skin is flawless, nearly shimmering up close. A light mix of vanilla and dark chocolate filled my nostrils while I walked so close, so I took a deep whiff. Why didn’t I meet guys like this at home? All I got was smelling like days-old smoke, alcohol, sweat, or like they’d emptied an entire can of Axe on themselves. This was so much better—subtle, but oh so tempting!\n\n“You silly girl, I don’t need other girls if you become my mate! It would only be you and me forever!”\n\n“Hey, hold on just a second! Friends, I said friends. Why do you keep saying mates? Being friends doesn’t mean you can’t get a girl! I can’t deal with your horny ass for the rest of my life; please go get a girl!!”\n\nHe looked at me for a long time, and I tried not to notice how his eyes lingered, adjusting my black top. This top was incredibly form-fitted, but in return, it really made my breasts look perkier. I’m not going to complain; I’m not mentioning it. I will never give the pants back! And everything is better than that napkin dress!\n\n“Hey! What…!?”\n\nI pushed him a little back as he leaned closer and smelled me! He smelled me! I haven’t showered since, I don’t know, since I was at Gabe’s house! Yuck! But even if my hands were firmly placed on his chest, he kept leaning closer and taking my smell in with deep breaths. It felt like he was about to lie on top of me, so I jumped back and got up to my feet, and so did he.\n\n“What are you doing? Boundaries, Luca! Boundaries! That’s just creepy!”\n\n“How long have you been here?”\n\n“How long? Do I smell that bad? Great! I have no idea! I don’t even know where here is!”\n\nFrustration got the best of me, and so did the embarrassment; who likes to smell like sweat and crap next to a demi-god-looking model? Pervert or not. A little subtle, I tried to smell myself.\n\n“You’re human, aren’t you?”\n\nI arched a brow and laughed. Was he also one of those cosplayers? Maybe one of those who took things a little way too far? Damn. All the pretty ones are either gay, taken, or butt-shit crazy!\n\n“Of course I am! What else would I be? A unicorn with titties? Get a grip, man!”\n\n“Oh god! I should have known!”\n\nI frowned; he leaned forward and hid his face in his palms.\n\n“What?”\n\n“You came here with the wolves? And the rest of the girls?”\n\n“No wolves, just bulging assholes, but yes, there were a couple of other girls. Tied up, I might add!”\n\n“Fuck… we need to leave! NOW!”",

        "content": "Elisabeth’s POV\n\nHe threw dirt over the fire, and we ran; I had no idea why, but I figured if something scared the grin off his face, it was worth running for!\n\nWe stopped by a beautiful little waterfall hidden in a small clearing. We had been running in a dense, moist forest with overgrown trees and bushes for hours, so this was a welcome sight!\n\nA little oasis of peace and beauty in the middle of the dark and thick woods.\n\nI was sent to gather sticks and branches for wood. It had made me a little jumpy—all this running and Luca’s stressed demeanor. So, I kept looking over my shoulder, waiting for a monster to appear. It did, of course, not!\n\nBack with my arms full, I saw him wrap two fish in big leaves and tighten them with something that looked like very long grass.\n\nWe sat in silence and watched the flames. We were waiting for the fish to cook.\n\n“Why do you keep calling those men wolves?”\n\nHe sighed. “Because they are. I fucked up! Let’s eat first; I have a lot to fill you in on. But I need food!”\n\nHe changed; he stopped trying to eat me up mentally and devour me with his eyes. For some reason, this freaked me out a little. The air around us was filled with the most delicious smell, and my stomach started growling.\n\nHe used a stick and plucked both fish packages out of the glowing coal, cut the rope, and served it just like that—a whole fish cooked in a leaf—and it was the best thing I had ever tasted!\n\nIt was perfectly cooked with incredible seasoning, and it practically melted on my tongue! A moan escaped my lips, one of genuine pleasure! And when I opened my eyes to take a new bite, Luca’s intense stare met mine. His mouth was open, he held the piece of fish right in front of it, and his eyes rested on my lips.\n\nI pretended I didn’t see him and focused back on my food. Eventually, he shook his head and started eating again. I hid a little smile.\n\n“Are you going to talk soon?”\n\n“Yeah, if you start eating normally!”\n\n“I do!”\n\n“No, yes, no! You eat that fish like it is the most important thing in the world! And you… You moan!!! Who moans while eating? And you call me a perv!”\n\nI nearly choked on my food.\n\n“I… I did not! It’s good, okay! It’s really, really good!” I retorted, savoring the taste with my eyes closed. “The best I ever tasted, even!”\n\nI’ve tasted fish before; Mom sometimes bought food before she gave the last piece of her soul to the addiction. It was a dry and burned piece of a fish nugget. I didn’t lie when I said it was the best thing I had ever tasted; it was.\n\nLooking over at his flustered face, I couldn’t help myself. I started laughing. This was all so surreal! This place, this situation, this food. All of it!\n\n“So, let me get this straight. You have no problem drinking me in with your eyes, asking to touch my breasts, and trying to get into my pants. But you can’t handle me moaning?”\n\n“I never tried that! I enjoyed the view! Eat your food!”\n\n“Yeah, sure, but I’m waiting?”\n\nHe perked up and looked over again. “Waiting?”\n\n“For you to tell me what the fuck is going on and where I am!?”\n\n“Ah, that. Fine, let me just…”\n\nHe mumbled something for a moment. I swear he was cursing under his breath, but his voice turned so strange. Like light bells and clicking sounds. Then he turned his focus back on his fish, and without even looking, he said, “Don’t scream…”\n\n“What do you…”\n\nI screamed! I nearly wet my pants too!\n\nThe ground broke in several places around me, and green roots stretched out and spun around my legs, pulling me down. It looked like I was tied to the ground! My breath was sharp and shallow as I looked over to Luca for help.\n\nHe only continued to eat. “I told you not to scream. Sit still, and it will be fine!”\n\nLuckily, I had nearly eaten all my food because I somehow managed to throw it all aside. I watched the roots or twines with wide eyes as I tried to catch my breath. They moved; they moved on their own!\n\nWiggling my legs, I discovered I was stuck. Every time I moved, they tightened. I didn’t dare take my eyes off them. I just dug my nails into the ground and stared at them.\n\n“Luca?!” My voice was shaking, and my head was spinning. They did move; they moved around my legs!\n\nHe put his food aside and handed me a little bag that looked like it was made of hide. Hesitantly, I tore my eyes off my feet, pinned to the ground, stared at the bottle, and then at him. I didn’t manage to utter a word. Didn’t he see what I saw!?\n\nPulling on a thin leather thread, the bag opened, and he pushed it against my lips and lifted it. Water! It was filled with cold water. I was thirsty and swallowed, but I still looked at him like he was the only thing keeping me sane.\n\nWhile the cold water poured down my throat and cheek, he started talking. “So, ehm, I don’t even know your name?!”\n\n“You never asked. I don’t just give it to everyone I meet… But I’m Elisabeth, and you can call me Elsa.”\n\n“Why would I call you that? Never mind. Welcome to Arthia, Elisabeth, Earth’s twin sister.”\n\n“Earth’s sister? What the heck is that supposed to mean? I’m still in America… right?”\n\n“Yes, and no. The planet is much the same; they were created at the same time and given the same resources, but they exist right beside each other without existing in the same universe. The easiest way to explain it would be a parallel world.”\n\n“You’re drunk, aren’t you?”",

I’m going home and calling the police!”\n\nHe snorted. “Police? They can’t do shit here, and what would you say? Big bad men kidnapped me; they are wolves on another planet? They would send you straight to a closed-up asylum, and then they would come back and pick you up again. How are you even going to get back?”\n\n“I’ll walk until I find a road and flag down a car.”\n\nI refused to accept this nonsense; this was utter bullshit, and I started to get angry. Kicking my feet, the roots only tightened even more, to the point where it began to really hurt!\n\n“Luca, get me out of here! I’m leaving now!”\n\n“I can’t! Don’t you understand? There are as good as no females born in this place. You are human. They will find out! And if they knew I helped you, I’m as good as dead!”\n\n“Stop this!”\n\n“So, how do you explain the roots around your feet? The pants I brought you? The growling and their yellow eyes? You’re not that stupid!”\n\n“Fine, let’s say you’re not the one belonging to an asylum. Why the heck would they kidnap girls? And bring them here? Do you do this, too?”\n\n“Of course not; only the Vikings can travel between the worlds. You are here because there are no more female wolves left. They cross the time and space seal every five years to get a new batch.”\n\n“New batch, like they’re getting supplies! You are sick! Let me go!”\n\nThis time, I tried ripping them off, tearing at the things tightened around my legs, and a sudden sharp pain made me scream out.\n\n“LUCA! Stop it! Please stop it!”\n\nI have no idea what he did, but suddenly, they loosened and pulled back down into the earth. All I could do was stare at my feet in disbelief. Blood trickled down over my leg where something like a thorn had pierced my skin, and Luca started swearing.\n\n“Come, quick! They will smell the blood!”\n\nHe grabbed my hand and dragged me with him to the edge of the forest. He looked over bush after bush before suddenly finding what he was looking for. A little red flower—he plucked it and rubbed the petals between his palms. It turned to blue slime, and he started to rub it on my legs. It burned like hell, but the bleeding stopped.\n\n“It will hide the smell of blood. They might be werewolves, but their animals smell blood like sharks in the water. Keep it on. We need to keep moving.”\n\n“Where? If they will know anyway, what’s the point in running?”\n\nI was growing tired of this little game. But at the same time, he had some good points. These are mostly thin explanations, but anyway.\n\n“I have a plan.”\n\nIt was all he said as he walked back to the fire, and we put it out and dug dirt over it. I wanted to go in the opposite direction, but honestly, I had no idea what I should do in the first place. So, I followed him.\n\nFor a long time, we walked in silence. After a couple of hours, it was getting dark around us, and Luca stopped.\n\n“Help me find more of these.”\n\nHe lifted something that looked like weeds, only covered in tiny orange dots. Taking a closer look, they moved! No feet, nothing—just orange dots moving around on the green. Behind some bushes, we found a place where they were growing in abundance. He gave me a fistful and told me to eat them.\n\nI grimaced. “Ehm, nope! Not that hungry!”\n\n“Not for the hunger, eat them! They will cover our smell and body heat.”\n\nI forced myself to eat them. They tasted disgusting, and several times, I felt like I was going to be sick. Really sick! But when I finally finished them, the feeling was gone. By that time, the sky was filled with tiny stars and a half-moon.\n\nI was given a thick cloak, much warmer than any duvet I ever had, so I didn’t complain as we lay down in the grass looking up at the clear night sky.\n\n“You never told me your plan?”\n\n“We are going to the Viking village.”\n\nI sat up and stared at him. “Are you crazy? I can’t go back there! They knocked me out and tied me down! And didn’t you say they kidnapped us for a reason?”\n\n“It’s better than running, believe me! I have a plan! Just get some sleep.”\n\nHe turned around, back to me, and I just kept staring. Did I believe all this? No, no, I don’t. Do I want to go back there? Hell no.\n\nI tossed and turned until I finally fell asleep, despite the fact that I was sleeping outside, right on the ground. I wasn’t freezing and fell into a deep slumber.\n\n***\n\nThe sun’s rays danced over my face when I woke up. I stretched out and rubbed my eyes before I sat up. I was looking around.\n\nThe scenery was beautiful; red, blue, yellow, and pink flowers decorated the green grass, bushes, and even trees around me. Birds were singing, and bees were buzzing nearby. I pushed Luca to wake up—only to realize he wasn’t there.\n\nThe grass was flat where he had slept, but he was gone. So was his cloak. I jumped up and listened.\n\n“Luca?!” I didn’t dare to shout, but I looked around and said his name several times. Should I be scared, or should I run?\n\nI didn’t get to finish the thought before I heard steps behind me. I sighed, irritated, and spun around to feel a sharp sting on my neck. I felt dizzy, and in seconds, I fell to my knees. With my hand, I managed to rip out a needle from my neck. I blinked hard as my sight slowly became blurry, and out of the blur, Luca came walking beside two men.\n\n“Try to run now, little rabbit.”\n\nSomeone laughed, but I was falling. The sound of my heart filled my ears, and before I fell forward, all I could mumble was:\n\n“Coward.”",

        "content": "Elisabeth’s POV\n\nThere was that wobbling feeling again. Bouncing from side to side, I groaned. My body ached, and I struggled to find my balance. Opening my eyes, it was dark, but after blinking a couple of times, I saw the sun forcing through the walls in small creaks.\n\nPushing myself against the wall behind me, I managed to sit up to discover my hands were tied behind me. Trying to move my feet only uncovered that they were tied up. Great! Back to square one.\n\n“Don’t look so disappointed, little one.”\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and I quickly looked around. I saw nobody, but I swear I could recognize the voice. That deep, hoarse voice. In my memory, yellow eyes and growing canines appeared.\n\n“You again?” I grunted.\n\nOf course. Luca betrayed me; he didn’t have a plan. He led them straight to me. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back as he laughed.\n\nI pretended I dozed off; I didn’t even bother answering him, and after a while, he stopped talking. My heart was racing in my chest, and a thousand thoughts were spinning around in my head. Everything Luca told me.\n\nSuddenly, the carriage stopped, and two doors were opened wide. I squinted as the bright light burned in my eyes. Before I could adjust, I was lifted and thrown over his shoulder, and he jumped straight out of the carrier.\n\nA squeal forced its way through my lips, and it was met by cheering, whistling, and howls.\n\nHowls?\n\nI struggled to adjust to the bright sunlight, but I saw people. Many people. Small houses, and they all had that strange look. Leather clothes or thick, rough fabrics. Tattoos, braids, and shaved parts of their heads. All different, but at the same time, they all belonged under the same category somehow—like well-groomed barbarians.\n\nI felt like he was parading me through the place, and I had no choice but to hang there like prey over his shoulder. People stopped and stared. Men—men stopped and stared. I heard a couple of kids but didn’t see them, and I got a glimpse of a young woman sitting outside a house by a little fireplace. But that was the only female I saw. Unlike the men, she didn’t seem excited or smile, and a lump formed in my stomach as I met her eyes. Sad, she looked like she was sorry for me, and that vague smile, which didn’t reach her eyes, made me feel like she knew something I didn't. What have I gotten myself into?\n\nI straightened my back as a firm hand grabbed my ass before I was hoisted down. I glared at him, and he had the audacity to wink back before he bent down in front of me and untied my feet. I turned around, expecting him to untie my hands. Instead, I almost fell forward because he smacked my ass so hard it burned! I gasped for air at the sudden sting, and a burning sensation spread out on my cheek. These pants don’t do me any favors against the impact, that’s for sure!\n\nI said nothing as he grabbed my wrists and guided me in front of him. Grateful I didn’t need to see his face right now, as I could feel the blush blooming on my cheeks. Was it wrong to enjoy the fact that my ass felt so tiny in his massive palm? Yes… Yes, God! Get your head straight!\n\nHe pushed me through a door, and it closed behind us. We entered a dark but well-lit room: no windows, but a big fireplace and several burning candles. Walking further in, we ended up in front of two big chairs next to each other. I rolled my eyes a little; they looked like thrones for medieval kings. We stopped. The room was open before the thrones, and a man was slumped down there, polishing a dagger with a thick leather cloth.\n\nBefore I could study him, bulky McBraid beside me slid his hand up my back to my neck and pushed my head down forward so I nearly bowed. And he kept my head there. I struggled against him, but his hand dug into my hair, and the grip tightened.\n\n“Alpha, I found the runaway.”\n\nHe was looking down, not meeting the other man's eyes. I studied him from the corner of my eye; he didn’t even try to look up. Respect and submission, damn. These guys really take their role-playing to the next level.\n\n“Good, Bo, hand her over to the girls and get her ready.”\n\nThe man answering had a deep voice, but it was so calm and confident that it made me want to shake him. He can’t just sit there and act like this is normal!\n\n“Yes, Alpha. Not to step out of line, but she missed the…” He paused a little, like he was searching for the right word. “Introduction. This is a little wild cat; I think she needs the encouragement.”\n\nI furrowed my brows and shook my head. I saw him grin beside me, but his grip on my hair was still firm. I couldn’t even stand up. I swallowed as the room got quiet, the metal clanged against the compact wood of the throne, and I more felt than heard him walking toward us.\n\n“Rise!”\n\nHis firm tone sent shivers down my spine, and before I could even react, McBraid pulled me up with him, still with his hand dug into my hair. A tall, dark-haired man met my gaze, older and broader over the shoulders. His eyes were yellow, and he looked me up and down. But I felt more like I was being judged this time, and I squirmed under his intense stare.\n\n“Your name?”\n\nI cleared my throat before I answered, and to my frustration, it ended as a hoarse whisper.\n\n“Elisabeth…”\n\nHe hummed and looked at my pants, walked around me like he was assessing an animal, but for some reason, I didn’t move. My heart was racing, and my throat felt so dry.\n\n“From now on, it is Eir. You will always refer to me as Alpha Birger, with no exceptions. Do you understand?”\n\nHe kept my gaze, and I just nodded.\n\n“Good.”\n\nHe grabbed my chin and turned my face from side to side. I felt like a mare on the market—looking for all imperfections—and I suddenly felt really self-conscious.\n\n“She will behave, won’t you? Take her to get ready, walk past the training grounds, and let her see there.”\n\nIt was more a statement than a question, with no room or need for me to answer, so I didn’t say a word. They both stared at me, and he arched a brow, waiting. The grip on my neck and hair tightened again, so hard that tears stung in my eyes.\n\n“Yes, Alpha.”\n\n“Good enough. Go!”",

At least I’m not hanging over his shoulder with my ass in the air.\n\nBo, not McBraid—Bo—walked me in front of him, and we stopped by a large open field where men were fighting, training, and sweating in tiny shorts. We stopped, and I stared—at sun-kissed skin, bulging muscles, and loud grunting. I didn’t get to watch long before they all turned their attention toward us, and I just wanted to sink down into the dirt.\n\nI tried taking a couple of steps back, but I ended up walking into Bo. His massive figure felt like a warm wall behind me, and the crowd of bare-chested men stalked toward us. It really felt like all eyes were on me, and for once, I didn’t like it. I was trapped like an animal, and the vibrating rumble in Bo’s chest that spread down my spine didn’t",

Eyes burned on my skin from behind, staring at us from all directions. Hungry. Focused. Greedy, lusting looks that took in our every curve. Every inch of exposed skin.\n\nI felt naked and exposed.

As I ran deeper into the woods, the adrenaline pumping through my pulsating body began to feel like panic, and not before I ran up to one of the girls who had fallen did I stop. She was crying, so I helped her up, but speaking to her was impossible. She was so deep down in her own panic, so devoured by her own fear, I didn’t think she even knew I was there. With one hand clenching over her bleeding cut, she pushed past me with her elbow, and I fell on my back right into a thick bush.\n\nOf all the places, that’s where I ended up catching my breath. I just lay there and felt my heart pounding in my chest. Slowly, the pulsating rush in my ears faded, and my heart stopped trying to break through my rib cage, and I just listened. I watched the clear blue sky. What was I doing? I freaked out like a deer caught in the headlights. Closing m",

I clawed my way up, the howls echoing in my mind. Sweat trickled down my back, and I reached a small flat area before I managed to calm down. Far up the mountain, my eyes wandered, taking in the scenery. Wild was the first word that crossed my mind. Wild and untouched nature as far as the eye could see.\n\nA picturesque view, more breathtaking than any pictures I’ve ever seen. The sun colored the sky and the ocean on the horizon on its way down—deep purple, light pink, warm orange, and bright yellow. Then, the backside of my little plan struck me; I saw everything from here, and there was nothing for me to hide behind. Scrambling to get to my feet to take in the mountain behind me, I wasn’t even halfway up. But if I went around this first ridge, at least I could put the hill between us this first night.\n\nIt w",

But I didn’t dare to move, breathe out loud, or crawl out to check. I stayed put and did my best not to fall asleep through the night. Again, I must have fallen asleep in the late-night hours because I jerked up and realized the sun was shining outside.\n\nI listened to birds, wind, and insects. That’s it, so I breathed out.

That sweet, alluring arousal filled my nostrils, and I had to fight my wolf not to jump her. The scent filled my head and my lungs. Swirled around in my body like a tempting mist. A greedy, fast-growing lust made my breathing heavy. Addictive and dangerous! When I finally snapped out of it for a moment, I had to turn my back.

I nearly laughed out loud, but then every fiber in my body was on high alert.

        "content": "Katelyn’s POV\n\nHow long have I been running? I don’t remember. However, I can’t stop now. I have to keep going. I have to get as far away from there as possible.\n\nMy paws pound on the forest floor as I dash around a tree and over a fallen log. With each step, my legs cramp a little more, but I can’t pay attention to it now. I have to get away.\n\nWith sheer determination in my eyes, I focus my attention on the terrain ahead. My escape almost came to a crashing halt a few minutes ago when I took my eyes off the path ahead, and I almost slammed into a tree trunk. Good thing my wolf has good reflexes.\n\nI still can’t believe that I could be this stupid. What was I thinking?\n\nOh, yeah. I hoped that when my mate turned eighteen, he could finally sense my presence, so he would love me and claim me. What a joke.\n\nI’ve known since my eighteenth birthday—which was two years ago—that the one person I’ve hated for these last few years is my mate. However, being the coward I am, I didn’t tell him. Well, it didn’t help that he would continuously tease and belittle me.\n\nPlus, I didn’t have enough courage to walk up to the Alpha’s son and announce he was my mate. Everyone would have laughed at me, so I kept my mouth shut.\n\nHowever, I never would have expected what happened a few days ago. My heart aches just thinking about it. No. I have to forget. I have to move on.\n\nMy wolf whines. Even though my mate didn’t mark me, my wolf already knows who our true mate is and still wants him. However, that will never happen now.\n\nUgh… I have to keep going.\n\nAs I dash over the crest of a hill, my eyes suddenly lock onto the glow through the trees on the horizon. Yes. I have finally made it to a big city. They should have a bus station there, and I can go as far as the bus will take me. Now, I just have to blend in with the humans and not be discovered. I can do this.\n\nI suddenly have a spring in my step, and with renewed energy I bolt ahead. I should be able to make it to town before morning. All I need to do is find something to eat and a place to clean up. Then I will start my new life.\n\n***\n\nI settled down into the back seat of the bus. For the first time in the last two years, I finally have hope. My heart still aches, and my wolf still wants to go back to our pack, but I know that isn’t possible now. However, I’m sure my father is looking for me, and that is why I have to get as far away from my pack as possible.\n\nI’m positive my father has tried to contact other packs, but I can’t have them find out my real name. From now on, Katelyn is gone. She died the moment I left my pack.\n\nThe only person left is the new one that I have created. Welcome to my new life, Brenda.\n\nI sigh as I turn my head and look out the window. There are so many uncertainties about the future, but I can’t let that control my life. For once, I need to live for myself. Not for my parents. Not for my mate. Not for the family name. No. I will only live for myself now.\n\nI hope the Moon Goddess is on my side now. If she is, she will guide me to the place I need to be and to a place where I can heal. Someday, I will be 100% again. Only then will I be able to come out of hiding, but not before.\n\nI don’t even know if there are werewolves where I’m going. My father has never talked about this area before. Well, it is rather far from my pack, but my pack has never dealt with any werewolf packs in this area. So, I can only assume that there aren’t any out this direction, which is why I’m heading there. From now on, I will live as a human.\n\nI have gone to college for a couple of years. However, now I won’t be going back, which, surprisingly, I’m fine with. Well, I’m sure the fact that my mate is starting there next semester is helping with my not wanting to go there.\n\nUgh… I have to stop thinking about him.\n\nAs the bus begins to move and head down the road, I continue to watch the scenery as it slowly begins to blur past, and for the first time in my life, I think about what I want to do with my life. I have nothing holding me back now.\n\nFirst thing is I have to get a job, and then I might think about going back to college. Is there even a college around this area? I’m sure there is. I will look into it when I get there.\n\nAs I continue to think about the possibilities, my eyelids slowly close, and sleep quickly consumes me.\n\n***\n\n“Hey, Miss. You need to wake up. We are at the end of the line.”\n\nWhat? Someone nudges my shoulder as my eyes slowly flicker open. Oh, my body is stiff. How long have I been sleeping?\n\nSHIT!! Did I miss my stop?\n\nI whip my head up and look at the bus driver. “Where are we? I was supposed to get off…”\n\nThe older gentleman smiles and interrupts me. “You looked so tired that I didn’t want to wake you. Even now, I let you sleep on the bus for several hours, but it is time for me to go home. You need to get off now. I have gotten your bag out from the luggage compartment and put it next to the bus.”\n\nWait! I missed my stop. I don’t even know where I am.\n\nI don’t know what to say. However, my mind seems to suddenly begin working as I mumble, “Is there even any place to find a job around here or eat? I don’t even know where I’m going to sleep tonight.”\n\nThe bus driver gently pats my shoulder as he softly replies, “Don’t worry about that. You can come with me to the pack house, and we will figure things out. I’ll talk to the Alpha and see if he will let you stay with us.”\n\nDid he just say pack house and Alpha?\n\nFor the first time after waking up, I finally look at the bus driver’s face. This is the first time in years that I’m actually met with a warm smile. The few gray hairs scattered around his dark brown hair seem to give him an air of experience, but also a sense of wisdom.\n\nAs I continue to stare blankly at the bus driver and think about what I should do, he gently grabs my arm and chimes, “Let’s go. It is about suppertime, and if we don’t get there on time, those rascals may eat everything.”\n\nI still don’t know what is going on, but I don’t protest. I let the older gentleman pull me out of my seat and guide me off the bus.\n\nWe grab my one bag, and he guides me to a car in the parking lot next to the bus station. I still don’t know what is going on, but the thought of having a meal at a pack house warms my heart.\n\nAn image of me when I was younger suddenly pops into my head. I was only about ten at the time, and I had gone to another pack for several weeks to visit my aunt and uncle, along with my cousins. I was so excited to finally be back home and with my parents that I went running into the pack house. I didn’t care that it was mealtime.\n\nWhen I dashed through the doors and into the dining hall, I was met with my mother’s joyous smile and her open arms. I ran across the room and threw myself into her arms. Her soft voice happily hummed, “Welcome home, baby. I’ve missed you so much.”\n\nWithin seconds, my father was also hugging my mother and me. His warm voice whispered in my ear, “Welcome back, princess.”\n\nMy father was never a person for a lot of words, but I felt so loved at that moment. I never wanted to leave that spot.\n\nAs I get into the vehicle, a lone tear slides down my face as the realization finally hits me. I will never see my parents again.\n\nThe older gentleman gets into the driver’s seat, and as he starts the vehicle, he softly chimes, “By the way, I’m Gus. I don’t know what you have gone through, but clearly you are running from something or someone. I hope you aren’t too mad at me, but that is why I let you sleep through the whole bus route. You looked so tired, and I can only imagine that you have been running for a while.”\n\nI slowly nod my head as I look down at my lap. How can he figure that out? Do I look that bad?\n\nI softly reply, “I’m Brenda.”\n\nThe vehicle begins to move, and I shift my eyes to look out the window.\n\nGus continues, “I have already linked with the pack and asked for you to take shelter with us. I just can’t let someone so innocent and pure suffer. Plus, you are a rare Omega, and it isn’t safe to have you roaming around without your pack.”\n\nShit. I didn’t even think about that.\n\nAnother lone tear slides down my cheek as I bite my lower lip and hum, “Hmm.”\n\nAs we pull out of the parking lot and head down the road, Gus lightly pats my arm. “Don’t worry. Our Alpha is a good guy. His mate was killed in a fight a few years ago. We have always been hiding, thus the reason why many of us have jobs in neighboring towns. We have also learned how to hide our scent, so other werewolves can’t detect us. They think we are just humans.”\n\nOh, so that is why I didn’t realize that he was a werewolf.\n\nI continue to stare out the window as Gus continues. “Our Alpha, Wyatt, is excited to meet you. You will be the first Omega from the outside of the pack he has ever met. Unlike most other packs whose Lunas are Betas, our pack usually has an Omega for our Luna. However, Wyatt’s mate was a Beta, which was a first for us. She was killed in a fight a few years back.”\n\nI nod my head. Well, besides my best friend Bridget and her mother, who are also Omegas, this is the first time I’m hearing of other Omegas. Can it really be true?\n\nHowever, I can’t focus on much else as my heart and body ache.\n\nRight now, I just want to eat, take a bath, and get some rest.\n\nAs I watch the scenery whiz past, I can’t help but wonder if they will let me stay. I have nowhere else to go, and Gus even said that the pack stays hidden. Would they allow me to stay hidden there, too?\n\nIs this where the Moon Goddess wants me to be?",

        "content": "Katelyn’s POV\n\nFear slowly consumes me as my mind won’t stop asking question after question. Will they like me? Are they a peaceful pack? Will they really let me stay?\n\nThen my mind slowly turns to darker questions. Will they make me work like a slave? Shoot. Will they try to sexually assault me? NO! I’M STILL A VIRGIN! They can’t do that.\n\nShoot. I still haven’t had my first kiss. I have been waiting for my mate, but that won’t ever happen now. He has already claimed and mated with the Alpha’s daughter from another pack. Oh, I have to stop thinking about this.\n\nI’m sure that everything I’m thinking about surely won’t happen. I need to have faith in the Moon Goddess.\n\nGus stops the car in front of an enormous house. No. This isn’t a house. It is a freaking mansion. A very huge mansion. What kind of pack is this?\n\nI lean forward in my seat as my mouth drops open. You could probably fit all the buildings my pack has in this mansion and still have room for more buildings from other packs.\n\nA soft chuckle fills the vehicle. However, I can’t tear my eyes off the mansion. I can see more buildings behind it and to the side of it that are also big, but not as big as this main building.\n\nGus softly chimes, “It is a pretty big house. I guess I should have warned you.”\n\nWith my eyes still on the mansion, I slowly nod my head. I don’t even know what to say. What do you say to something like this?\n\nGus nudges my shoulder. “Come on. We have to get in there before the meal starts or those darn rascals will eat everything and leave us nothing.”\n\nHe opens the driver’s door and gets out. However, I’m still in a daze. I somehow manage to open the passenger door and get out of the vehicle, but my mouth doesn’t seem to want to work. I silently follow Gus to the mansion.\n\nHe opens the door and allows me to go first. I still don’t know where I’m going, and I stop right inside the door as I mumble, “Thank you.”\n\nGus smiles and steps into the entryway as he closes the door behind him.\n\nI think I have left my confidence in the car. However, I have never been in a situation like this before.\n\nMy hands begin to sweat and tremble. I hope everything is going to be all right.\n\nGus walks past me and further into the mansion. I slightly lower my head and follow right behind him. I don’t want to get lost in here. I don’t think I could ever find my way out.\n\nWithin a few steps, we walk into what looks like a living room, but it could also pass as a game room with all the video game consoles, cartridges, and gaming chairs. Well, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to tell that they like playing video games.\n\nA small smile quickly spreads across my face, but it quickly disappears as we walk further into the house, closer and closer to voices. Wait. Are they arguing about something? Shoot. Does this mean that they are a pack of warriors? My father once told me that packs who are born to be warriors often fight over the simplest things.\n\nWould I fit in with a pack of warriors? Oh, I don’t know if this is a good idea or not.\n\nI grab the hem of my shirt and begin to fidget with it.\n\nGus lightly pats my shoulder. “Brenda, calm down. We aren’t going to do anything to you. We are a peaceful pack. Granted, we are a secret and very well-hidden pack, but we are peaceful. I wouldn’t be surprised if you have never even heard of us before.”\n\nI glance down the hallway toward the growing loud voices and slowly shake my head. “My father never mentioned anything about any packs in this area. I went to a human high school and college, so of course, they didn’t mention anything about werewolves being here either.”\n\nA small smile appears on Gus’s face. “What did you learn about this area in school?”\n\nI think for a bit. What did I learn about this area? Was it good in farming? Think, Katelyn. It isn’t that hard of a question.\n\nWait! I remember!\n\nI suddenly pop my head up and chime, “Business. This area has some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the country. The teachers also told us they were all human businesses.”\n\nGus chuckles and shakes his head. “Well, you are partially right. We have some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the country located in this area, but those big companies are all owned and operated by werewolves. Our Alpha, Wyatt, along with the previous Alpha, Wyatt’s father, own and run those companies.”\n\nI tilt my head and ask, “Then why are some of the pack working elsewhere, like you are working as a bus driver?”\n\nGus pats my arm a little harder. “Not all of us are cut out for working in an office. Plus, I have an alternative reason for being a bus driver.”\n\nAn alternative reason. What is it?\n\nConfused, I mumble, “What?”\n\nHe looks forward toward a large set of double doors and chimes, “You can call me the gatekeeper.”\n\nThe gatekeeper? What is that supposed to mean?\n\nBefore I ask, Gus strides forward and grabs the door handle. “We are here. Now the younger ones can be a little rowdy, so don’t be surprised.”\n\nI nod my head. “Okay.”\n\nGus pulls open the door and the loud noise instantly stops, and the room becomes completely quiet.\n\nThis is it.\n\nGus steps into the dining hall. I hesitate for a moment and take a deep breath.\n\nAfter a few moments, I tentatively step into the dining hall and slowly scan the room. Dang. That is a lot of werewolves. It would take at least three of my pack to equal the number of werewolves in this room right now.\n\nMy knees wobble as I take a few small steps and get closer to Gus. He is the only person I know, and he has been so kind to me.\n\nGus clears his throat and announces, “Everyone, this is Brenda. I don’t need to tell you much. Most of you can tell already, but for the ones who can’t yet, I will tell you she has had to leave her pack.”\n\nBefore Gus can continue, a cute guy steps forward and begins walking toward us. “I have agreed to let Brenda stay here, so please make her feel welcome. Also, since she is one of the few Omegas that I’ve met, she will stay with me to make sure that no one does anything to harm her. Since I have a mate bond, she has nothing to worry about with me. Do you understand?”\n\nEveryone in the room instantly yells, “Yes, Alpha.”\n\nDid I call him cute? He isn’t just cute, but he is also beautiful. I thought my friend Alex was the only beautiful guy, but I’m mistaken. Wyatt is stunning, and he isn’t even my mate. Well, Alex isn’t my mate either, and I think he is beautiful, too.\n\nWyatt smiles at me as he strides toward me. If Gus hadn’t told me he is a Beta, I would believe that he is truly an Alpha, albeit a short Alpha, but I would still think he is an Alpha.\n\nI couldn’t help but wish that I could be a little like him.\n\nPeople only have to take one look at me, and they immediately know that I’m an Omega. I wouldn’t know what I would do if people looked at me and thought I was an Alpha. Oh, that is asking for too much, but maybe I can get him to help me look like a Beta instead. I definitely think I can get the confidence to give off a Beta aura.\n\nAs I’m lost in thought, Wyatt marches up to me and engulfs me in a hug.\n\nThis is so different from my pack. I have friends, yes, but to get such a warm welcome is something new to me. My pack reserves greetings like this for a select few, and I’m not one of them, even though my older brother is part of that select few. I’m sure it is because he will be the pack’s next Beta, following in our dad’s footsteps. I don’t follow in anyone’s footsteps, especially now.\n\nUgh… I need to stop thinking about this.\n\nI tentatively wrap my arms around Wyatt and whisper, “Thank you, Alpha Wyatt.”\n\nWyatt hugs me even tighter and whispers, “Not a problem. Our pack sticks together and welcomes Omegas with open arms. There aren’t too many left.”\n\nWell, he has a point. I, however, want to play it safe and make sure not to make waves. If it helps that the Alpha is willing to protect me, then I’m not going to argue or disagree. Plus, I can’t explain it, but I already feel like I’m part of the family. I don’t know how, but I do.\n\nWyatt lets go of me and takes a step back as he chimes, “Brenda, you will sit at the head table with me. Are you hungry?”\n\nBefore I can even respond, my stomach answers for me with a loud growl, which instantly has Wyatt and Gus chuckling. I quickly put my hand on my stomach and lower my head as I mumble, “Sorry.”\n\nWyatt shakes his head and chimes, “Don’t be. Now, let’s get you fed before your stomach starts talking even louder.”\n\nI simply nod my head and follow him as he turns around and heads toward his table at the end of the room. Oh, I can’t believe that my stomach growled like that. This is so embarrassing.",

        "content": "Katelyn’s POV\n\nWhat have I gotten myself into? I follow Wyatt to his area of the mansion. I don’t even know where my bag is.\n\nShortly after I sat down for the meal, one of the pack members took my bag. She said that she would put it in my room, but I don’t know where that is. Now I’m following Wyatt through the various halls, which feel more like a maze than a house. Wyatt did tell me, as soon as we met, that Omegas need to be protected, but what does that really mean?\n\nWait. Does that mean I have to sleep in the same room as Wyatt? I have never shared a bed with anyone. I had been planning on doing that only with my mate. Dang. Why did I have to think about him?\n\nWith my head lowered, I bite my bottom lip as I try to keep my tears from forming yet again. Over the past few days, I think I have cried enough for that idiot. I know my wolf is yearning for him, but he is no longer my mate. Well, technically, he could be, but I’m not going to go back and fight for him. I’m not stupid. I know when there is a fight I can’t win.\n\nPlus, he has already claimed that girl. My wolf could feel the pain and betrayal when he claimed her. Luckily, I was already far enough away from my pack that I didn’t need to run full speed anymore. I didn’t stop running, though, but the pain was too much to be able to continue running at full speed. I slowed down to a walk and bore through the pain until it lessened, and I could resume running full speed again.\n\nWyatt slows down and stands beside me as we continue to walk through the halls. However, he says nothing. Does he know what I’m going through?\n\nSuddenly, Gus’s words at the bus station come flooding back to me. How does he know that I’m running away from something? I could have just been going to visit family. He didn’t know. However, the look in his eyes almost makes me think that maybe he knew, but how?\n\nAs my lip begins to tremble and the tears well up in my eyes, threatening to spill over, Wyatt puts his arm around my shoulder and pats me in a brotherly way. “Don’t worry, Brenda. I don’t plan on doing anything bad to you. I just want to protect you. An Omega is very rare, and you have had such a rough time lately.”\n\nHow does he know? Did I say something and not remember?\n\nWyatt softly chimes, “There are many things that make our pack special, and in time, hopefully, you will learn to accept them. However, tonight isn’t the time to discuss them. I first want to get you comfortable and then tomorrow we can talk about whether you would like to stay in our pack. If you decide to stay, which I hope you do, then we can discuss what your role will be, but for now you need to sleep.”\n\nWhy do I have a feeling that there is a reason why this pack is hidden?\n\nI slowly nod my head.\n\nWyatt gently rubs my arm as we walk along the hall. “Good. I have put you in the room right next to mine, which is located in the Alpha section of the house. There are guards that are constantly around me 24/7, even if you don’t notice them, and that section of the house has a group of security guards along with security codes to be able to enter. I will show you how to enter and give you the codes, so you can come and go freely. No one other than us is allowed in that section of the house, unless we request someone.\n\nIf you are wondering why, it is so when I go into heat, I have a safe place to stay until it is over. Since my mate has passed away, I still have my heat and unfortunately, I wasn’t aware of that little fact until it happened. That first time was rather scary, even being the Alpha of the pack.”\n\nI nod. However, my curiosity wins as I softly mumble, “How can you be a Beta, but the Alpha of the pack? I didn’t think that was possible.”\n\nA chuckle escapes his mouth. “Well, that is one difference with our pack. I’ll go into more detail tomorrow, but for now, you need to rest.” He pauses for a moment and then adds, “Stop crying over him. He is stupid if he believes the girl is his mate. He is still too young to understand the difference between lust and the mate bond. It is better you are rid of him now. We will take good care of you here.”\n\nWhat? How does he know? I have said nothing to anyone, and I’m not linked with the pack for me to accidentally tell them through a mind link. No. There has to be something more.\n\nWhen I was linked to my old pack, no one could read my mind like this.\n\nWyatt scolds, “Don’t worry about it tonight. I will tell you everything soon.”\n\nHe pulls me down a smaller corridor toward a small flat screen built into the wall on the right side of a steel door, while one guard is standing to the left side of the door. If I was in a bank, I would think this is the entrance to the bank’s vault, but that isn’t the case.\n\nAs we approach the door, Wyatt pulls me to the flat screen. I also notice that my bag is lying in the corner. Oh, so they didn’t actually take it to my room, but that is fine with me.\n\nWyatt steps up to the small flat screen. “This is a two-step system. You first have to place your hand on the screen and then you have to punch in the right security code. The only other person who has access to this area is my Beta, Ford. You haven’t met him yet. He is away doing some pack business, but he will be back soon.”\n\nI silently stand and watch as Wyatt presses his hand on the flat screen. Within seconds, his name flashes across the top of the screen. He then removes his hand, and a keypad appears. Wyatt enters a code.\n\nClick. Click. Click.\n\nShoot. How many locks are on the door? Well, at least I know I will be safe when I have my heat. Wait. I haven’t had a heat yet. Why haven’t I? Is it because my mate was so much younger than me?\n\nWyatt picks up my bag and then puts a hand on my back as the guard opens the door. Wyatt softly chimes, “Let’s go inside and I’ll show you around.”\n\nAs soon as we are inside, Wyatt stops right inside the door. He looks over his shoulder and waits for the door to close.\n\nClick. Click. Click.\n\nWhen he is sure that all the locks are once again locked, he smiles and turns his attention toward me. “Let’s first get you in the system so you can come and go as you please.”\n\nHe hands me my bag and then walks to a picture that is hanging on the wall near the door. He slides his finger under the edge and suddenly the picture swings open.\n\nI watch in awe. My old pack has nothing like this. With my father being the pack’s Beta, I would have known about things like this. The only thing that we have that is remotely close to this is the security for the safe room in case we are attacked.\n\nWyatt chuckles as he types onto another flat screen that is hidden behind the picture. “Don’t worry. Our safe room has security too, but not quite like this. This is only reserved for things that are of utmost importance, and I guess I qualify in that area.”\n\nHe finishes typing and slowly turns around. “And now, you do too. Come over here and let the system scan your hand. Then we will set your passcode.”\n\nThis is too much to take in. However, I don’t complain, and I step closer to him. He gently takes my hand and presses it on the flat screen. After a few moments, my name, Brenda, flashes across the screen.\n\nHe releases my hand as I continue to stare at the screen.\n\nHe turns his head toward me and asks, “Do you have any preference for a five-digit security number?”\n\nI stop and think for a moment, but nothing comes to mind. I slowly shake my head.\n\nWyatt turns his attention back toward the screen. “That’s all right. We don’t want it to be anything that is too easy to figure out, so how about I just pick one.”\n\nHe types a number on the flat screen. When he is done, he turns back toward me and smiles. “I have selected 22020. It means the second month of 2020, being when we met. Can you remember that?”\n\nA small smile spreads across my face as I nod my head. “Yes. I think I can remember that.”\n\nHe turns back toward the flat screen and types a few more things before he steps back and swings the picture back into place.\n\nI silently wait and watch. For someone who is a Beta, he is confident and sure of himself. I have said it once already when I first heard about him, but I can’t stop myself from thinking about it again. I wish I could be a little like him. I don’t care if I have the aura of an Alpha like he has. I just want to be able to be confident and sure of myself. I don’t like the fact that I have hidden so many things from my family and friends. Only Bridget knows some of my struggles. She is the only one who knows I found my mate two years ago and have kept quiet, waiting for the day my mate turns eighteen and comes to find me on his own.\n\nMy heart suddenly aches once again. Why did I have to think about him?\n\nWyatt gently grabs my arm and pulls me further down the hall. “My area is like a small apartment inside the house. I have everything here, so when I’m having my heat, I don’t need to leave for anything. I have my own kitchen along with my own washing machine and dryer, so I can wash my own clothes if need be. In addition, I have a small fitness room too, so I can still exercise when I’m locked in here.”\n\nHe takes me down the hall and we pass a few doors. He points his finger to the door on the right and chimes, “That is the fitness room, while the room across the hall is my office. Our bedrooms are at the other end of the apartment. Oh, don’t worry. We each have our own bathroom attached to our own bedrooms. The kitchen and the living room are in the middle with the laundry room just off to the side of the kitchen.”\n\nI let him pull me down the hall as I nod. Well, at least the apartment is simple enough that I don’t think I’ll get lost. I know I will most certainly get lost in the mansion these first couple of weeks as I try to navigate around.\n\nI know Wyatt keeps calling it a house, but it isn’t anything like a house. It is just too big to be called a house.\n\nWhen we walk into the living room and the kitchen area, my mouth nearly falls onto the floor. Shoot. I spoke too soon. The living room is enormous, and it isn’t just a living room. It also appears to be a game room too. In addition, it opens to a dining room area where I can see the kitchen through the door.\n\nOh, my. From the little I can see, the kitchen looks huge too. I should have known better than to think Wyatt’s room would be like any other normal area. Nothing in this mansion is normal.\n\nWyatt softly chuckles as he chimes, “Come. I’ll show you to your room and you can take a bath. I’ll go look to see if I have any additional clothes that will fit you.”\n\nOnce again, I simply nod my head. Will I ever get used to this?",

        "content": "Bridget’s POV\n\nWhere is Katelyn? I have tried repeatedly to get someone to search for my best friend, but everyone seems to just ignore me. Well, not everyone is ignoring me. Katelyn’s father, Beta Malcolm, has sent search groups out, but they keep coming up empty.\n\nHow could she just disappear like that? I know she has to be miserable and in pain right now. I could see it in her face as Alpha Marcus announced that his son, Mike, had finally found his mate.\n\nI wanted to stand up and scream that the girl wasn’t Mike’s mate, but I can’t. It isn’t acceptable for someone like me to stand up against Alpha Marcus. Now, Katelyn could do it, but I know she won’t. She has kept the identity of her mate a secret from everyone except me for the last two years. She only had a couple more months before Mike turned eighteen, and then he would be able to find his mate on his own. However, that all has come crashing down in an instant.\n\nIf only she had told her dad, Beta Malcolm would have been able to say something, and he probably would have been able to stop this whole mess. Not only did Katelyn get deprived of her true mate, but the girl’s true mate—whoever it is—is deprived too.\n\nSo many lives have been altered, and for what? An alliance? Well, I hope that the Moon Goddess teaches those idiots a lesson.\n\nMy only glimmer of hope is that I can still feel Katelyn through the mind link. She has blocked the pack from linking to her, but she is still alive. I know Beta Malcolm and his wife can sense it too, but it doesn’t help us in trying to locate her. I don’t know what I’ll do if that connection with her ends. No. I’m not going to think about it. That won’t happen.\n\nIt has been weeks since she left. I haven’t been able to leave the pack and go back to the university yet either. It would be of no use anyway. I can’t concentrate on anything but finding her.\n\nUgh. Do you think if I ask Beta Malcolm to let me go find her, he will let me?\n\nI glance around the living room of the pack house. I wonder if anyone would go with me if I went.\n\nHowever, my blood instantly boils when my eyes land on Mike and the whore. Oh, excuse me. Her name is Bambi. Even her name sounds like a stripper’s name.\n\nI can’t stand to look at them for very long since Bambi has her arm draped around Mike’s shoulder as she sits on the armrest of the couch while Mike sits on the couch with a game controller in his hand. I can’t help but mentally laugh at how the slut is trying to rub her hip up against Mike’s arm while he completely ignores her and focuses on the video game.\n\nEven though I find it hilarious, I have to fight the urge to hurl, because Bambi keeps her hair pulled back, proudly displaying her mark. That mark should be on Katelyn’s neck instead of hers. My friend only wants to be happy with her mate, but she isn’t allowed.\n\nI hope when I find my mate that I don’t have to deal with the same situation as my friend. Well, I know one thing for sure. I will rip my mate’s balls off and shove them down his throat if he does something like what Mike has done.\n\nOh, let’s not think about that right now. We have to first find Katelyn and then I’ll worry about my mate.\n\nUgh. What am I going to do?\n\nI turn my attention away from Mike and Bambi as I think of my options. However, no matter how many times I think about it, there is only one option. I have to go looking for her.\n\nI have told no one, but I have this ability to sense where some people are. At a young age, I could always tell where Katelyn was long before I actually could find her. I don’t know how to explain it, but there seems to be a bond there. I have that same connection with my family and a few other people.\n\nThat is why I know my friend is still alive. I can sense her, and I know she is somewhere northeast of our pack.\n\nI sigh as I make up my mind. I really have only one option. I have to ask Beta Malcolm for permission to try to find Katelyn by myself.\n\nI turn toward the hallway, and I walk out of the room while I try my hardest to ignore Mike and the bitch.\n\n***\n\nBeta Malcolm stops the car at the local bus station and turns off the engine. “Now, I want you to check in every day, no matter what. I don’t want to have two missing Omegas from our pack. I wish you would agree to having someone go along with you. You have no idea how dangerous it is out here, especially for an Omega.”\n\nI still can’t believe that Beta Malcolm is letting me do this. However, I have a feeling that he didn’t ask Alpha Marcus about it. Well, the Alpha doesn’t seem too concerned about a little old Omega, even if it is his Beta’s daughter.\n\nI guess Mike doesn’t fall too far from the tree.\n\nIt still shouldn’t surprise me that Alpha Marcus is the one who came up with the stupid plan to get Mike mated to someone other than his true mate. I know his wolf can tell. I just can’t figure out why Mike can’t. Plus, did Alpha Marcus forget it will be hard for Bambi to produce an heir since Mike isn’t her true mate? It is a given that at some point Mike is going to have to have an heir to continue on the lineage and to lead the pack in future years. How is he going to do that without getting Bambi pregnant?\n\nShoot. Why am I even worrying about something like this? I need to focus on Katelyn.\n\nI glance over at Beta Malcolm and nod. “I know. I will call every night and let you know what I’ve been able to find that day. I won’t forget. I promise.”\n\nBeta Malcolm turns in his seat toward me. “And don’t forget to call your parents too.”\n\nA smile dances across my face as I nod again. “I won’t forget. Don’t worry.”\n\nHe leans back in the driver’s seat and reaches inside his suit jacket. He pulls out a wad of cash and hands it to me. “Here is some money. Don’t lose it. I won’t be able to get any more money to you without people knowing.”\n\nI look down at the bundle of cash. I don’t have to ask what he is referring to.\n\nWithout admitting to it, he just confirmed my assumptions. He never asked Alpha Marcus to allow me to go look for his daughter. So, he can’t have anyone find out that I’m searching for her.\n\nI nod my head and mumble, “Thanks. I’ll be careful.”\n\nI take the cash and pull enough bills off to pay for my bus ticket, and then I put the rest in my pocket. I need to make this stretch, but I’m still holding out hope I can find her rather quickly.\n\nI glance back over at Beta Malcolm. I don’t know if it is the morning sun, or he is losing his ability to hide his emotions, because I can clearly tell by his frown and the creases across his forehead that he is worried. I won’t lie. I’m really worried too. It has been a month since she disappeared.\n\nThe only reason Beta Malcolm has finally agreed to let me go look is that I wouldn’t leave him alone. Plus, when the last search came back with nothing, Alpha Marcus refused to send out anyone else to look for her. Beta Malcolm couldn’t handle it. He wants to find his daughter.\n\nI reach my hand out and gently pat his shoulder as I softly chime, “I will find her. I promise.”\n\nHe looks at me and for a few moments, we just stare at each other. We don’t have to say anything. We both know that this is our final and only option left. It has to work this time.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he takes a deep breath and slowly nods his head.\n\nI mumble softly, “Thanks.” I don’t wait for him to respond as I open the car door and get out. I quickly grab my large bag from the back seat and walk away from the car toward the bus station.\n\nI hope this works. The only thing I know for sure is that I need to head northeast. Maybe as I get closer to her, I will be able to feel her presence more, and I’ll know then for sure where I’m going.\n\nBeta Malcolm watches Bridget’s back as she disappears into the bus station. Bridget is his last hope. If she doesn’t find his daughter, he doesn’t know what he’ll do. He doesn’t want to give up, but what is left?\n\nIf he had only known his daughter was Mike’s true mate sooner, he could have stopped this whole nightmare from even happening. However, he didn’t even protest when Alpha Marcus said that Bambi was Mike’s mate.\n\nBeta Malcolm should have known the Alpha wouldn’t know who Mike’s mate was, but the Beta trusted and believed the Alpha, which is his fault. Yes, Bambi is older, and that alone doesn’t trigger any warning flags. However, the Beta should have realized something was off when Bambi came into the pack house for the first time. She was too calm.\n\nIf she was truly Mike’s mate and with her being nineteen, she should have gone a little bonkers with her mate nearby. However, she didn’t seem to be pulled toward Mike at all.\n\nHe is also positive that Alpha Marcus is behind this farce. Well, he is sure that the neighboring pack is pretty happy with the new alliance, but they wouldn’t have been able to get close to Mike if it wasn’t for his own father helping. However, the Beta still is trying to figure out why the Alpha would do something like that to his own son.\n\nDid the Alpha forget that Mike will still feel a little lost? Yes, the bond with Bambi will be there, but it won’t be like it would have been if Mike were mated with his true mate.\n\nBeta Malcolm sighs as he runs his hand through his hair. How is he going to fix this mess? Or can it be fixed?",

        "content": "Katelyn’s POV\n\nI can’t believe I’m actually learning to fight. I made a simple comment to Wyatt that I wish I could be more like him, and bam—Ford and Mason are teaching me to fight. I think I could have handled just one teacher, but with both of them, it is like an intense lesson. When one has to leave to take care of something, the other one comes in and continues with my training.\n\nUsually, Mason is my primary teacher since he is the lead warrior and is the one leading all the training sessions, while Ford is Wyatt’s Beta. Between the two, they have taught me in an extremely intense training session every day. I don’t even get Saturday or Sunday off.\n\nHowever, if this is going to get me to the level that Wyatt is at, then I’ll gladly work all these hours and more.\n\nWell, I have little else to do, so I might as well train.\n\nIf I were back in my old pack, I would be getting ready to go back to college. However, I don’t really miss that either because my parents forced me to study business when I really wanted to go through the medical program. Ever since I was little, I had always loved watching the doctors in the pack hospital. I don’t know if me being an Omega had anything to do with it, but the idea of helping people and trying to heal them is what I really want to do.\n\nHowever, I have already given up on that idea. My plan of disappearing means I can’t be found anywhere, and if I go back to college, I would definitely be found. No. I would rather not go back to college if it means I can continue to stay here.\n\nGranted, I haven’t been here long, but Wyatt has made me feel welcome, which means the whole pack has welcomed me. Now, I’m not saying I didn’t feel welcomed at my old pack, but I wasn’t liked by quite a few. For some reason, me being the Beta’s daughter—even though my older brother is the next Beta—meant that some people just couldn’t stand to be around me. I still haven’t figured out why, but at this point, I really don’t care.\n\nMason yells across the training field at me, “Hey, Brenda! Don’t be slacking! Ford will be here soon to continue your training!”\n\nI smile and yell back, “I’m just getting some water! I wasn’t slacking!”\n\nI shake my head and grab the bottle of water sitting next to my things on the bench. As I unscrew the cap, I glance around the training field. I’m still amazed that everyone is taught how to fight, even the Omegas. Wyatt keeps telling me it is the responsibility of everyone to learn to defend themselves and the pack. If they are the last ones left to protect the pack and the children, then they have to know how to stop an attacker.\n\nI had never thought about it before, but he is right. In my old pack, I was always told that Omegas can’t fight. They are too weak. But here, they are considered equals with the rest. That doesn’t just mean fighting but with everything. Everyone takes turns cleaning and cooking, except for the ones who just want to do one job. No one is forced to do something because of their status. Shoot. Even Wyatt helps cook and clean.\n\nI’m suddenly startled out of my thoughts as Ford’s deep voice asks, “Is there something bothering you, Brenda?”\n\nI glance to my side and look at Ford as I shake my head. “No. I’m just thinking about how different my old pack is from yours.” I take a drink of water before I scan the training field again.\n\nFord turns and looks out at everyone, too. “Well, there aren’t too many packs that think like we do, but we are also a secret pack. We have gone to great lengths to keep us hidden, which means we aren’t like all the other packs.”\n\nFord leans a little closer to me and softly adds, “And we like it like that.”\n\nA small smile spreads across my face as I take another drink of water. I still haven’t asked why they keep their pack hidden, but maybe when I decide to become part of their pack, I will ask.\n\nI put the cap back on the water bottle and set it down on the bench. “Are you here to continue my training or to talk about my old pack?”\n\nFord chuckles. “Well, I’m sure your old pack is interesting, but you still have a lot to learn in order for you to catch up with the others on your fighting skills. So, let’s get back to training.”\n\nI nod and head back out to the edge of the field where I usually do my training.\n\n***\n\n“Don’t forget to protect your side.”\n\nWell, I don’t think I’ll soon forget. Dang. He can really throw a punch. The sad thing is that it probably isn’t at its full strength. Regardless, it still hurts.\n\nI get up off the ground as I’m breathing heavily. “I’ll remember. Don’t worry.”\n\nFord pats my shoulder. “You are improving, and fast. I’m sure that it won’t take long before you are just as good as other people your age.”\n\nI put my hand on my side as it continues to throb in pain, and I shake my head. “I don’t want to be as good as others my age. I want to be as good as Wyatt. If he can do it, so can I.”\n\nFord smiles and nods his head. “I’m sure that you can.”\n\nMason walks up to us and chimes, “Brenda, you are getting better. Keep going, and you will get there soon. Oh, by the way, I’m going to have you fight another pack member tomorrow.\n\nI’ve kept you from participating so far, but I think it is about time you start to fight the others.\n\nDon’t worry. I won’t have you fight the older pack members first. Instead, you will start off with the younger ones, who are at about your skill level.”\n\nWhat? I thought I would have more time before I actually had to fight the other pack members.\n\nFord steps closer to me and gently pats my arm. “Don’t worry. You can do it.”\n\nMason quickly adds, “I wouldn’t have you participate if I didn’t think you were ready. Plus, we must get you to work up the ladder to the better fighters. That is the only way you will learn how to handle yourself in an actual fight.”\n\nWell, I guess. However, I still wish that I had more time for training.\n\nI slowly look between Mason and Ford. “I guess.”\n\nFord smiles and once again pats my arm. “Oh, I almost forgot. Wyatt wants to see you in his office as soon as you are done with your training today.”\n\nI nod my head.\n\nI wonder what he wants.\n\n***\n\nExhausted, I grab my things, but I don’t have time to go take a shower yet. I have to go to Wyatt’s office first, and then I can relax in a nice warm bath later.\n\nOh, my muscles really need it.\n\nI don’t even look over my shoulder as I lift my hand and wave. “Thanks, Mason, for another hard day of training. I’m off to meet Wyatt. Bye.”\n\nHe chuckles. “Don’t worry. I’m sure that it isn’t anything serious.”\n\nHow does he know that I’m worried about it? I swear, just when I think I’ve figured something out about this pack, I’m left gaping and wondering if I’ll ever figure anything out. Well, Wyatt did say I’ll learn the pack’s secrets, or at least some of them, when I become part of the pack. However, until that happens, I’m left confused and lost.\n\nI sling my bag over my shoulder and head off toward the Alpha’s office. The sooner I get there, the faster I can figure out what he needs.\n\nAs I walk past the various houses and buildings, I suddenly think about Bridget. I usually try not to think about her too much because it makes me sad. I miss her so much.\n\nFor some strange reason, I can sense that she is heading toward me. I don’t know why I’m getting that impression, but I am.\n\nDang. I must miss her a lot. It has always been Bridget who could find me with no effort. When I would ask how she could do it, she would always tell me she could just sense my presence and knew where I was. However, now, I’m the one getting the feeling that she is coming to me.\n\nI shake my head. This pack is making me crazy. Well, that isn’t all bad.\n\nI push the notion of my best friend out of my mind as I continue on my way to Wyatt’s office.\n\nWithin minutes, I’m at his office. My mind is still trying to figure out what he wants as I knock on his office door.\n\nKnock. Knock.\n\nHe calls out, “Come in.”\n\nI open the door and walk in. “Did you need to see me?”\n\nHe looks up from his computer monitor and smiles. He waves me to sit down in a chair in front of his desk. “Yes. I wanted to talk to you about your college. I already know where you were going to school, but I have never asked you what you were studying.”\n\nI step forward and take a seat as I tilt my head. Why does he want to know about my college? Now that I had left my previous pack, I already knew I wouldn’t be going back. I was one of only a handful of people that were allowed to go. I’m sure my father’s status had something to do with it, but I don’t have that here.\n\nHere, I’m a nobody, and I already know I won’t be able to finish my education. I really didn’t like what I had been studying, but that doesn’t matter now.\n\nInstead of answering his question, I ask, “Why do you want to know?”\n\nHis smile falters a bit as a line slowly forms across his forehead. “Am I not allowed to ask what you were studying? Is it some kind of secret?”\n\nI slowly shake my head. “No. It isn’t a secret. I just want to know why you are asking. I have already accepted the fact that I won’t be going back to college, so it doesn’t really matter anyway.”\n\nHis smile widens again as he playfully teases, “Who says that you aren’t going back?”\n\nI don’t understand.\n\nA frown slides across my face. “Well, isn’t it obvious? I ran away from home, so there wasn’t anyone to pay for my tuition. Plus, I don’t want my family to know where I’m at and try to force me to go back home. So, I can’t just call up my school and ask them to forward my records to another university. If my father talks to my old university, he will know right away where I’m at.”\n\nI stare at the Alpha as his playful smile continues to dance across his face. For once, since I’ve gotten here, I can’t understand what he is even thinking. Usually, he and I are pretty close in how we think, but not this time. I have no idea what is going on in his head.\n\nA gleam in his eyes suddenly sparkles as he leans forward and rests his arms on his desk. “What would you say if I said you could be enrolled in our university here with no problems? Granted, our university has both werewolves and humans together, but the only werewolves admitted there are wolves from my pack. We are the only ones that can hide our scent, so if we have other werewolves come to campus, they will think the university is full of only humans.”\n\nIs he for real? There is no way he can do that. Is there?\n\nThere is no way they can really do that. Right?\n\nHe doesn’t even know my real name.\n\nWyatt chuckles. “As Alpha of the pack and the owner of the university, I can do that, and I have done it in the past. As for your real name, I already know it too. I have just chosen not to let you know. There are a lot of things I know about you…” He pauses for a second and looks at me as a smirk playfully dances across his face.\n\nHey, there is no way he knows what my name is. I don’t talk in my sleep, and I know I have said nothing to anyone. Brenda is the only name that I’ve used. I’m sure of it.\n\nWyatt softly chuckles again. “Brenda is the only name you have used since you have been here, but that doesn’t mean I don’t know what your real name is, Katelyn.”\n\nMy mouth immediately falls open. How did he do that?",

I continue to let Ford pull me through the halls of the pack house before he rushes into a room and pulls me in with him. He slams the door shut, and before I can say anything else, he captures my lips in a searing hot kiss.\n\nI have never kissed anyone before, but at this moment, I don’t care if I don’t know how it is to be done. I just want to have his lips wrapped around me. I don’t care if it is my lips, my neck, or anywhere else on my body. I need those lips to be in contact with me.\n\nMy wolf howls in excitement as a burning fire ignites deep inside of me. My mind keeps chanting the same thing over and over.\n\nClaim him.

The only bright side is that we are werewolves, and we heal fast.\n\nA part of me also feels like an idiot. I never thought that there was so much to know about finding and claiming your mate.

Then the male would whisk the female off her feet before heading to the bedroom, where they make love and claim each other.\n\nI didn’t know that the wolf takes over at some point and the mates become two wild beasts, trying to devour each other.

However, I don’t want to force her if she doesn’t feel the same way. Plus, she is still heartbroken over that idiot mate of hers claiming someone else.

I have been through so much in my life so far that I don’t know if I have the courage to try and trust someone or another pack again.\n\nI should have been able to trust my parents’ pack, but I was sadly mistaken. They didn’t have any issues with female Betas, but since I’m an Omega, they thought I was cursed and would bring trouble to the pack. I have never figured out how being an Omega would bring trouble to the pack, but they believe it, and that is all that matters.\n\nI glance forward at Bridget and then Ford, who are sitting in the front seat, while I sink further down into the back seat of the vehicle.\n\nBridget seems really nice.

        "content": "“You’ll be fine,” Indianna’s mother said, and waved her hand dismissively at her daughter.\n\nIndianna looked out of the car window and raised her dark eyebrows at the large red-bricked building in front of them.\n\n“Just be social and make friends!”\n\n“Social,” Indianna muttered, and grabbed her bag from the back seat. “Sure.”\n\nShe climbed out of the car, ignoring her mother’s cheerful wave goodbye. She slammed the door behind her and glanced up at the school, looking around the car park that was flooded with students, laughing and talking to their friends.\n\nStudents who noticed Indianna.\n\nIndianna groaned quietly and swung her bag over her shoulder. She lowered her gaze as she made her way up the steps that led to the school and didn’t look up as she walked through the bustling corridors, gritting her teeth and flinching every time she accidentally bumped shoulders with someone. She thought that if she couldn’t see anyone, then maybe they couldn’t see her either.\n\nShe knew she was being stupid.\n\nThe town that Indianna and her mother had moved to wasn’t small, but it wasn’t big either. Not everyone knew each other personally, but they would recognize a new face from a mile away. This made Indianna’s anxiety rise.\n\nShe hated being noticed.\n\nShe clutched her hands tighter around the strap of her bag and carried on down the busy corridor. She had come to the school a few days before, and the principal had shown her around, so it didn’t take her long to find her locker. She fumbled with the lock and hurriedly grabbed the textbooks that were stacked neatly inside, stuffing them into her bag.\n\nIndianna hated that she could feel everyone’s curious gaze on her. She hated that she stood out. She swallowed nervously and looked at the crumpled piece of paper in her hands. She scanned the timetable and saw that her first lesson was history. After putting her timetable back into her pocket, she braced herself and walked down the rowdy corridors, hoping to find her class quickly so she could get a moment of peace before she was surrounded by a room full of new people.\n\nIndianna let out a sigh of relief when she made it to her classroom. It was relatively empty, so she made a beeline straight to the back of the class. Now there were no eyes on her. She let her shoulders relax and leaned back in her chair.\n\nOne year, she told herself. She had to survive for one year in this new town, and then she was free. She would graduate and be able to go wherever she pleased.\n\n“Hi!” Indianna’s heart jumped in her chest when a blonde, curly-haired girl appeared next to her. She was smiling brightly and had kind brown eyes. “You’re Indianna, aren’t you? The new girl? You’ve moved to town with your mother, right?”\n\nIndianna stared at the blonde girl with wide eyes. She had wanted to go unnoticed, but this girl definitely seemed to know her. Indianna wasn’t sure how to respond.\n\n“Sorry,” the girl apologized and sat down next to Indianna, noticing her discomfort. “I didn’t mean to scare you off. I just thought I’d introduce myself! I know what it’s like to be new in this town. I moved here a year ago. I’m Brooklyn, but everyone calls me Brooke.”\n\nIndianna nodded and looked at her hands. She picked at her chipped nail polish and hoped this girl would go away. Indianna wasn’t good with people. She’d rather be left alone.\n\nBrooklyn blinked and waited for Indianna to speak. She frowned when there was an awkward silence and chewed on her lip.\n\n“Not a people person?” Brooklyn wondered. “That’s okay, people would argue that I can talk enough for two people.”\n\nIndianna’s eyes flickered to Brooklyn, who was smiling.\n\n“You can talk to me. I promise I don’t bite, like some people in this school,” Brooklyn said kindly, with a laugh.\n\nIndianna stiffened and shook her head. “No,” she whispered. Her voice was gentle and soft.\n\nBrooklyn frowned. “No?”\n\n“Don’t talk about that, please,” Indianna said quietly.\n\n“Talk about what?” Brooklyn asked, cocking her head to the side curiously.\n\n“Biting,” Indianna muttered, forcing the word out like it was poison.\n\nBrooklyn noticed how Indianna grabbed her wrist, her eyes flashing with panic.\n\n“Oh, I’m sorry,” Brooklyn said quickly. “I didn’t realize that was a sensitive topic. Sorry, I talk a lot and sometimes I say stupid things—I’ll… I’m going to shut up now—Brandon, thank God, hi!”\n\nBrooklyn looked up as a guy approached the desk. He had the same blond curly hair as Brooklyn and matching brown eyes.\n\n“Brooke, you’re not terrorizing the new girl, are you?” he teased. He had a wide smile, and he looked at Indianna with inquisitive eyes.\n\nEveryone here was interested in the new girl. No one knew anything about her or her mother. To the town, they were a mystery, and in small towns, everyone liked to unravel the mystery of new people quickly.\n\n“No!” Brooklyn laughed and hit Brandon’s arm as he sat down next to her. “Well, not purposely. Indianna, this is Brandon, my cousin. Brandon, meet Indianna.”\n\n“Hi,” Brandon said warmly. “It’s nice to meet you, Indianna.”\n\nIndianna swallowed and looked up at him, forcing a smile. “Hello.”\n\n“She’s a little shy,” Brooklyn said, pointing out the obvious personality trait that she had noticed in Indianna.\n\n“After a few minutes with you, I’m sure that will change,” Brandon said, nudging Brooklyn’s shoulder with his elbow.\n\nIndianna looked up at the clock on the wall and groaned internally. Seven minutes of the lesson had passed. If the rest of the year was going to pass as slowly as this, she didn’t know how she was going to survive.\n\n“Oh, great,” Brooklyn mumbled and sighed.\n\nIndianna looked up as three boys walked into the classroom, and she noticed how Brooklyn slouched down in her seat and avoided eye contact. Brandon glared and clenched his fists.\n\nTwo boys stood slightly ahead of the other one. There was a ginger-haired boy who was laughing loudly at the brown-haired boy, who was smiling and showing off his dimples. Behind them stood a boy with dark hair. His face was blank, and his eyes looked like cold, bottomless pits.\n\nIndianna’s heart raced at the sight of him. In a split second, he instilled fear into her, and she didn’t even know him. She noticed tattoos littering his arms, and she raised her eyebrows in shock. She had to remind herself that he was the same age as she was—not that you’d think that by his looks. He had an air of confidence around him, and he looked mean, unlike the other two boys, who didn’t have a dark look about them. The brown-haired boy looked kind, and the ginger-haired boy looked mischievous, but the dark-haired boy looked… dangerous.\n\nIndianna swallowed nervously and swiftly looked away when the dark-haired boy’s eyes scanned the classroom. All eyes were on them; the class seemed entranced. It was as if no one had ever seen these boys before. Indianna wasn’t sure if the looks they were receiving were of lust or fear.\n\nAn irritable expression flashed across the dark-haired boy’s face when he realized the class was staring at him and his two friends. Although he was used to it, he still glared and snapped, “What?”\n\nChills filled Indianna’s body when he spoke. A wave of butterflies rose up from her feet, making her body feel on edge. One word was all it took to make the class immediately turn their attention away from the three boys. His voice was deep and clear; it had cut through the silence of the classroom like a razor-sharp knife.\n\nIndianna couldn’t imagine kind words leaving the lips of the dark-haired boy. From one look at him, you could tell that being nice was foreign to him. It was then she realized that the looks they were receiving weren’t of lust; they were definitely of fear.\n\nIndianna turned to Brooklyn as the three boys sat on the opposite side of the classroom. She heard a loud laugh from the ginger boy, and she could see the dark-haired boy out of the corner of her eye, rolling his eyes at his ginger friend and kicking his feet up onto the desk in front of him.\n\n“Who are they?” Indianna asked quietly.\n\nBrooklyn adjusted in her seat, turning her back to the boys. “People you should stay away from,” she said firmly. “The ginger guy, he’s called Kal. The brown-haired one is Ace. The dark-haired one is—”\n\n“Greyson Evans,” Brandon scowled. “He is not a nice person.”\n\n“He has no regard for anyone but himself and his few friends. He’s a dick, he’s dangerous, and he uses girls for nothing more than sex. He’s bad news, and they are the one group in this town you should stay away from. Kal and Ace aren’t bad people, but you don’t want to get on their radar because then you’ll be on his—”\n\nBrooklyn was cut off by the deep, slow drawl. “I can hear you, Brooklyn,” Greyson called. He looked at Brooklyn from his seat, and she pursed her lips, turning to face him. “You’re not gossiping again, are you?”\n\nBrooklyn smiled sweetly. “I’m just telling the truth, Greyson.”\n\n“Well, I’m very interested to hear what you have to say,” Greyson urged, raising his eyebrows daringly at Brooklyn. “Continue.”\n\n“I highly doubt you would like hearing what I have to say,” Brooklyn said with a shrug of her shoulders.\n\nIndianna watched Brooklyn carefully and noticed that she didn’t seem afraid of Greyson, unlike the rest of the class. She glanced at Brandon, who was glaring—at the same time as Greyson did.\n\n“Brandon, if you keep glaring at us, I will punch you,” Greyson warned, and his eyes flickered to Brooklyn’s, glittering with dangerous amusement. “I know I shouldn’t, considering that you’re Brooklyn’s cousin, but you both know that I don’t care.”\n\n“Greyson!” Brooklyn said sharply. She narrowed her eyes at him. “You are not going to punch Brandon!”\n\n“And what could you do to stop me, Brooklyn?” Greyson wondered. “You may be surprisingly high up on the school social ladder, but I know of a guy who can keep you on your leash.”\n\nBrooklyn’s cheeks flushed red, and she pursed her lips when Kal snorted, smirking at Brooklyn’s discomfort.\n\n“Shut it, Kal,” she grumbled.\n\nGreyson tutted. “Don’t try and tell me what I can and can’t do, Brooklyn. You will always lose, remember that.”\n\n“Speaking of Harry,” Kal said, and winked at Brooklyn. “Where is he?”\n\n“Yes, great question, Kal. Where is Harry?” Greyson said to Brooklyn. “I know he was looking for you this morning.”\n\n“I don’t know where he is! Why would I?” Brooklyn said quickly and crossed her arms over her chest, narrowing her eyes at Greyson and his friends. “Now, please leave us be!”\n\n“As you wish,” Greyson scoffed, and Brooklyn turned back to Indianna.\n\n“As you can see, he’s an ass,” Brooklyn huffed and rolled her eyes. “Keep away from him. From them.”\n\nIndianna raised her eyebrows curiously and spoke quietly. “Why don’t you?”\n\nBrooklyn frowned. “What?”\n\n“Your boyfriend is his friend, isn’t he?” Indianna observed.\n\n“B-Boyfriend? What? No!” Brooklyn spluttered, and Indianna smiled ever so slightly.\n\n“Harry, that’s what they said his name was, wasn’t it?”\n\n“Observant.”\n\nIndianna jumped when Greyson appeared behind her, and he leaned back against the cupboard, crossing his arms over his chest. She stared at him, suddenly going silent.\n\n“Now,” he said, and looked Indianna up and down. “Who are you?”\n\n“I think it’s better if you don’t find out,” Brandon muttered. Greyson ignored him.\n\n“Her name is Indianna, and that’s all you need to know. So if you can just leave—”\n\n“I’m pretty sure she can speak for herself, Brooklyn.”\n\n“She’s shy,” Brooklyn said, glancing at Indianna, who looked like she wanted to be anywhere but in the classroom, talking to Greyson.\n\n“Well, come on. I don’t bite,” Greyson urged, and Indianna stiffened, just like before.\n\n“Don’t talk about that,” Indianna said. Her voice was still quiet, but it was firm.\n\n“Struck a nerve, have I?” Greyson wondered. He raised an eyebrow and smirked. “Somebody likes it rough.”\n\n“Jesus, Greyson!” Brooklyn gasped. “It’s her first day—leave her alone!”\n\nGreyson looked at Indianna with a scrutinizing gaze, and she squirmed uncomfortably. Indianna hated people staring at her. She had always lacked confidence and had always struggled to see the beauty she was lucky enough to have been born with. She was naturally pretty, with big green eyes, olive skin, high cheekbones, a button nose, and long brown hair. She hid behind large glasses and clothing that was on the baggier side. Pretty was a word she had never used to describe herself.\n\n“Indianna?” he said, and frowned, thinking to himself. “Hughs…?” he murmured.\n\nGreyson had spoken quietly, and Indianna wasn’t sure if she had heard him correctly. “What?” she asked, staring at him cautiously.\n\nGreyson smirked. “So, she speaks.”\n\n“What did you say just then?” Indianna asked shyly. She avoided eye contact.\n\n“It was nice to meet you, Indianna,” Greyson said slowly, dragging out her name. He pushed himself away from the cupboard and made his way back over to his seat, with Kal and Ace.\n\nIndianna watched with furrowed eyebrows as he whispered in their ears, and immediately they both looked at her. Slowly, she noticed their gazes travelling to her hand that was holding her wrist.\n\nCovering her scar.\n\n“What is wrong with you three?” Brooklyn gasped, noticing the three boys looking at Indianna. “Gosh, leave the poor girl alone! It’s her first day. She could do without the attention from you!” Brooklyn rolled her eyes once the three boys looked away, talking amongst themselves. “I’m so sorry. Just because everyone is scared of them, they think they can get away with anything. They’re a freaking nightmare!”\n\n“It’s fine,” Indianna said quietly, and looked at the door of the classroom, praying that the teacher would arrive quickly so she wouldn’t have to talk to anyone else.\n\nBrooklyn turned to Brandon, and Indianna zoned them out as they started a conversation. Indianna tapped her foot impatiently and rubbed her forehead as a headache started. She so desperately wanted to run out of the classroom, away from all of these unknown people. Indianna liked to be by herself. She—\n\n‘What happened to your wrist?’\n\nIndianna jumped in shock when she heard a voice. It was loud and clear, ringing in her head. She looked around in panic, wondering where it had come from. She wasn’t certain if the voice had spoken out loud… or in her head.\n\n“Are you okay?” Brandon asked, noticing Indianna’s wide eyes. He and Brooklyn both looked at Indianna in concern.\n\n‘Don’t panic, you are not going crazy.’\n\n“I, er…” Indianna choked on her words. The voice was definitely in her head. Was she imagining it? Was the stress of moving to a new town, being in an unfamiliar environment, surrounded by people who wanted to talk to her, making her go crazy?\n\n‘You’re not imagining it.’\n\n“Indianna?” Brooklyn said softly. “Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m fine,” Indianna whispered and rubbed her eyes. “I think I just have a bad headache coming on.”\n\n‘What happened to your wrist?’\n\nIndianna swallowed nervously and tried to control her breathing before she started to panic. Hearing voices was never a good sign.\n\n‘I told you, there is no need to panic. Just speak to me.’\n\nIndianna furrowed her eyebrows. She couldn’t help but notice a familiarity about the voice. She wondered if she had met this person.\n\n‘Who are you?’ she spoke in her head. It felt incredibly strange, and this whole exchange between her and the unknown voice felt horribly invasive. Indianna didn’t like it. ‘How do you know my name? How are you even in my head? Am I going insane—’\n\n‘No. Calm down. You are not going insane. Now, answer my question. What happened to your wrist?’\n\nIndianna paused, thinking. She wondered what harm could come from talking to this voice. It clearly wasn’t real. She guessed it was like talking to a figment of her imagination.\n\n‘Indianna.’ The voice was growing impatient, and seeing as Indianna had no idea how to get rid of it, she decided to answer its questions.\n\n‘It happened when I was younger.’\n\n‘I’m going to need a bit more information than that.’\n\n‘I was… attacked.’ Even in her mind, her voice sounded fragile talking about it.\n\n‘Wolves.’ It wasn’t a question, it was a statement. Indianna had a feeling that the voice already knew the answer to the questions he was asking.\n\n‘Observant.’\n\nIndianna’s head snapped to look at Greyson and his friends, but this time he wasn’t looking at her. He was looking down at his desk, drawing absentmindedly on the surface. She tried to remember his voice and wondered if there were any similarities between his and the one in her head.\n\n“What are you looking at?” Brooklyn wondered, snapping Indianna out of her thoughts. She followed Indianna’s gaze to Greyson and frowned.\n\nIndianna shook her head and looked at her hands, mumbling, “Nothing.”\n\nBrooklyn caught Greyson’s gaze and narrowed her eyes. He smirked and raised his eyebrows challengingly. Eventually, she looked away.\n\n‘Who are you?’ Indianna asked. ‘You’re not real, are you?’\n\n‘I am most definitely real, but who I am doesn’t matter.’\n\n‘It does if you’re in my head.’\n\n‘You talk a lot more when you aren’t physically speaking,’ the voice observed.\n\n‘So, I’ve met you. In person?’\n\n‘I didn’t say that.’\n\n‘You implied it.’ Indianna was a mixture of scared and irritated. She wanted to know who the voice was and how it was in her head.\n\n‘How old were you when you were attacked?’ the voice asked.\n\n‘I have a feeling you know.’ Indianna’s voice was hostile. She hated remembering the attack. ‘I was five.’\n\n‘Your father—he died, didn’t he?’\n\n‘H-How? How do you know this?’\n\n‘Lots of people know the story of the attack, but they don’t know that it’s your story, Indianna.’\n\n‘What do you mean?’\n\n‘Clearly not even you know the whole story.’\n\n‘Then tell me, seeing as you seem to know so much.’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘Why not?’\n\n‘It’s not the right time.’\n\n‘You are a voice in my head—I don’t care! You are scaring me! Now tell me how you know so much about me!’\n\n‘Just focus on making friends. You’re shy—take the chances you get. Brooklyn is a nice girl. Don’t ignore her by talking to me. You’ll hear from me soon.’\n\n‘Wait!’ But the voice was gone. It was almost like there was a presence in Indianna’s mind, and now it was gone, along with her headache.\n\n“Are you listening, Indianna?”\n\n“Hmm?” Indianna looked at Brooklyn, who smiled.\n\n“You’re shy and not very talkative, but I like you, Indianna,” Brooklyn said with a laugh.\n\n“Um, thank you?”\n\n“You are very welcome,” Brooklyn grinned and looked at Brandon. “What do you think of our new friend?”\n\n“I think that you’re going to take a while to warm up to us,” Brandon said with a chuckle.\n\n“Sorry,” Indianna said, forcing herself to talk louder. She smiled nervously. “I don’t trust easily.”\n\n“We’ve got time,” Brooklyn grinned, and soon all attention was turned to the teacher, who entered the classroom and began the lesson.\n\nIndianna was grateful to blend into the background once again. She spent the whole lesson lost in her own thoughts and couldn’t help but look over at Greyson. She had realized why she thought the voice in her head sounded familiar.\n\nIt sounded so much like his.",

        "content": "“Hello, Indianna.”\n\nIndianna looked up in surprise when Greyson sat next to her in their next class, French. She quickly lowered her gaze when he met her eyes and fidgeted nervously in her seat. She didn’t say anything.\n\n“Now, this would be where you say hi back, otherwise it would be considered rude, Indianna,” Greyson said in a low voice. He smirked, and his dark eyes twinkled with amusement when Indianna’s eyes widened and she forced out a quiet, “Hi.”\n\n“I don’t think I introduced myself in our last class. I’m Greyson Evans.” Greyson spoke with a confidence that Indianna had never had. You could tell that this boy was not used to being questioned or argued with. He was used to being in charge, and he liked it.\n\n“Yes, Brooke told me,” Indianna told him. She was certain that she was not going to forget who Greyson Evans was any time soon.\n\nJust the thought of him being within touching distance was making her nervous. Her skin was buzzing from their close proximity, and he seemed to take over all of her senses. She could feel his body heat, smell his cologne—she was drawn to look only at him, and when he spoke, all she could focus on was his deep, velvety voice.\n\n“Brooklyn,” he murmured and nodded. He was watching Indianna carefully, studying her. He was very aware that she was avoiding his eyes. “You’d do well to stick with her. Brandon, however, he’s a miserable dick.”\n\nIndianna’s eyes flickered to Greyson’s for a split second. “He seems nice.”\n\nGreyson rolled his eyes. “Not everyone in this town is who they say they are, Indianna.”\n\n“What is that supposed to mean?” Indianna asked curiously, her eyebrows furrowing.\n\n“Just be careful who you make friends with,” Greyson warned. His tone was firm, and Indianna couldn’t help but wonder why he cared.\n\n“But Brandon and Brooke—”\n\n“They are good people. I just don’t like Brandon.” Greyson waved his hand dismissively. “It’s not them that I’m talking about.”\n\n“I’ve not met anyone else.” Unless she counted the voice in her head.\n\n“I’m not surprised.”\n\n“Why?” Indianna found herself meeting his eyes.\n\n“You’re not exactly approachable, are you, Indie?”\n\n“Indie?”\n\nGreyson ignored her. “I get it, you’re shy. You’re not used to people, are you? I plan to change that, though. It’s not every day I get to help out a social outcast.”\n\n“What? I’m not a social—”\n\n“I’m teasing,” Greyson interrupted and chuckled. “Besides, do you know how many girls would kill to be in your position?”\n\n“No?”\n\nGreyson leaned closer to Indianna, and she sucked in a breath, staring at him cautiously.\n\n“With a click of my fingers, I could have anything I want,” he whispered. “People are terrified of me, but they also want me. And here I am, talking to you.”\n\n“Oh. Okay.” Indianna didn’t know what else to say. She wasn’t good with conversations or being sociable, especially when she was talking to someone as confident, self-assured, and cocky as Greyson.\n\n“So, Indie, why did you move here?” Greyson asked when it became obvious that Indianna was not going to carry on the conversation.\n\n“My mother wanted a change of scenery,” Indianna answered, but her voice was quieter, distant. She did not want to talk to Greyson anymore. She wanted to be left alone. She hated the looks she was receiving from students in the classroom, watching her with curious eyes, gossiping with their friends about how Greyson Evans was talking to the shy new girl.\n\n“Do you live with your father?” Greyson pressed, very aware of the students whispering about Indianna and him. However, he didn’t care about what other people had to say about him.\n\n“No,” Indianna answered after a silence. She fiddled with the ring on her finger. “He’s not with us.”\n\n“Away,” Greyson murmured and raised his eyebrows. “Okay.”\n\n“Why are you talking to me?” Indianna asked suddenly, surprising herself that she had the confidence. Indianna knew of boys like Greyson, and she knew that they did not waste their time with girls like her.\n\n“Because I want to. And I always get what I want.” There wasn’t a sliver of doubt in his voice.\n\nIndianna frowned, tucking a piece of her hair behind her ear, wondering what Greyson truly wanted, but she nodded and said, “Okay.”\n\n“What’s this?” Greyson asked, catching Indianna’s wrist and turning it over.\n\nIndianna paled, and her eyes went wide. Greyson felt her whole body go tense, and he could feel her pulse quicken. “Greyson, l-let go of me.”\n\n“What is it?” Greyson asked again, raising his eyebrows at her.\n\n“You’re making me uncomfortable!” Indianna squirmed and tried to pull her arm away, but she was not successful. She looked up into Greyson’s dark eyes and swallowed nervously. He seemed annoyed, and she was pretty certain that he was not going to let her go without an answer. “You can see what it is,” she whimpered eventually.\n\nGreyson blinked once and said, “How did you get it?”\n\n“How else do you get a scar of a bite mark on your wrist?” Indianna asked with a bitter edge to her voice that Greyson was surprised to hear. “You get bitten.”\n\n“You were attacked?”\n\nIndianna was silent.\n\n“Answer me, Indie. I do not like being ignored.”\n\nIndianna gulped and looked away from Greyson. He was starting to scare her, but she knew that the easiest option was to answer his questions, no matter how uncomfortable they made her.\n\n“Yes, I was attacked.”\n\nGreyson released Indianna’s arm, and she immediately shot out of her seat, attempting to get away from the boy who was intimidating and scaring her. But as quick as she thought she was, Greyson was quicker. He blocked Indianna’s path and looked down at her with an amused smirk.\n\n“Where do you think you’re going?”\n\nIndianna looked up at him in shock, her eyes widening in anger. “Are you insane?” she hissed. “Do you like terrorising the new girls? Is that what gets you off—” She groaned in frustration when Greyson blocked her way again and pressed her palm to her forehead. “Please, just let me pass!”\n\n“Don’t move,” Greyson said sternly.\n\n“You can’t tell me what to do!” Indianna snapped. Indianna was quiet and reserved. She had a temper, but it was buried very deep down. Greyson seemed to have no trouble digging it up. As Indianna’s temper grew, her shyness faded away. “Get away from me!”\n\nGreyson’s jaw was clenched, and he grabbed Indianna’s arm, holding her in place. “I said,” he whispered in her ear, his voice resembling something very close to a growl. Shivers ran down Indianna’s spine. “Don’t move. Now sit the hell down and do as I say.”\n\nAt this moment, Indianna was scared of Greyson. However, her anger was easily overpowering her fear and shyness. She thought she had met boys like Greyson before, but she was wrong. She had never encountered this before.\n\n“Who the hell do you think you are?” Indianna demanded. “My father? You can’t order me around, you’re freaking crazy! Now, get the hell out of my way or I will scream.”\n\nSuddenly, the cold look on Greyson’s face was gone, replaced with an expression that wasn’t kind, but a lot softer than it was. His grip loosened, and Indianna’s arm slipped through his fingers. His eyes darted back and forth as he looked at Indianna. Her eyes were wide and her cheeks slightly flushed.\n\n“It’s anger,” he said after a moment of silence.\n\nIndianna blinked, shocked at his sudden change in personality. “W-What?” she spluttered.\n\n“Anger,” Greyson said. “It brings out your confidence. It helps you to stand up for yourself.”\n\nIndianna’s mouth dropped. She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “You did that on purpose, didn’t you? You were trying to piss me off?!”\n\nGreyson’s lips twitched. “I wanted to test a theory,” he shrugged and dropped back into his chair.\n\n“You were scaring me! Why would you do something like that?”\n\n“I wanted to see how quickly you’d get angry.”\n\n“Why? That’s cruel!”\n\n“Don’t worry about it,” Greyson said dismissively, and he gestured to the chair next to him. “Are you going to sit back down?”\n\n“Tell me, Greyson!”\n\n“It’s not the right time.”\n\nIndianna suddenly froze. The voice had said that to her earlier.\n\n‘It’s you.’ Indianna looked at Greyson as she spoke the words in her mind. He was looking up at her, but there was no change in his expression. His face was blank. With a sigh, Indianna sat back down in her chair, not seeing Greyson’s lips form a smirk.\n\n‘I have no idea what you are talking about.’\n\nThe voice made Indianna jump, and she immediately looked at Greyson, growing. She realized that she could feel a presence in her head. It felt like this person was pushing his way through her mind, forcing himself in and invading her privacy.\n\n“Are you okay, Indie?” Greyson asked with a curious tone in his voice.\n\nIndianna narrowed her eyes and looked at her hands. “I’m fine,” she muttered and focused on the presence in her mind.\n\n‘You do know what I’m talking about,’ she insisted.\n\n‘No, I’m afraid I do not.’\n\n‘Just tell me who you are and what you are doing in my head! If you’re in my head, does that mean…’ Indianna stopped herself, but the voice answered her unanswered question.\n\n‘Yes. Yes, I can read your mind.’\n\n“Oh my gosh,” Indianna whispered. ‘Who are you?’\n\n‘I can’t tell you yet, Indie.’\n\nIndianna gasped, and she looked up at Greyson, who was now on his phone. He slowly turned to her. “Do you want something, Indie?”\n\n“I… er…” Indianna shook her head hurriedly. “No, it’s nothing.”\n\n‘You’re going to drive me insane,’ she said to the voice in her head.\n\n‘I’m glad I could be of service, sugar.’\n\n‘Sugar?’ Indianna questioned.\n\n‘Is there something wrong with me calling you sugar?’\n\n‘Yes. I don’t like it.’\n\n‘Then it’s perfect.’\n\nIndianna had only had two conversations with this boy, but she could imagine him smirking. He was making her blood boil. She already hated him.\n\n‘Aren’t you just a bundle of joy?’\n\n‘Stay out of my head. Leave me alone.’\n\n‘You’re no fun.’\n\n‘Get out of my head!’\n\n‘I’ll be back, sugar.’\n\nThe presence in her head disappeared, and Indianna let out a long breath. It was only the second period, and she already felt drained.\n\n“Are you alright, Indie?” Greyson asked.\n\nIndianna sighed and rubbed her eyes tiredly. “I have no idea.”",

        "content": "Indianna had made it to lunch, and she couldn’t be happier. All she wanted to do was find a quiet corner of the library and be by herself for the first time that day. During her third lesson, she had Ace, Greyson’s friend, trying to talk to her, and then Brandon in the fourth. They both seemed nice, but Indianna hated them talking to her. She was better alone. Being alone was what she was good at.\n\nThe voice hadn’t spoken to her again, and Indianna smiled as she opened her locker. Maybe she was just nervous and was imagining it? Indianna crossed her fingers and hoped that was the case. She placed her books into her locker, and when she shut it, Brooklyn appeared out of nowhere.\n\n“Indianna!” She grinned, making Indianna jump from fright.\n\n“You scared me,” Indianna said, and Brooklyn smiled apologetically.\n\n“Sorry,” Brooklyn laughed. Indianna wondered if Brooklyn was ever not happy. She had yet to see her without a bubbly smile on her face. “So, I thought, considering you don’t know anyone, do you want to sit with my friends and me at lunch?”\n\n“Oh…” Indianna bit her lip, shifting awkwardly on her feet. She avoided eye contact. “Um, thanks, but I was going to go to the library.”\n\n“You don’t want to meet everyone?” Brooklyn’s face dropped slightly, and Indianna felt guilty for turning her down, but she still shook her head.\n\n“I… I, er, I need to get some work done at the library,” Indianna made up an excuse as Brooklyn’s attention was drawn to someone behind Indianna.\n\n“I told you that you were a social outcast.”\n\nIndianna turned around to see Greyson looking down at her, raising his dark eyebrows in amusement.\n\n“Greyson!” Brooklyn gasped. “Don’t be rude!”\n\nGreyson smirked. “What? It’s the truth.”\n\n“You’re an asshole, but you don’t see me telling you that!”\n\n“I know very well what you think of me, Brooklyn,” Greyson said dismissively. “Why don’t you run along so I can have a chat with your new friend?”\n\nBrooklyn narrowed her eyes at Greyson and crossed her arms over her chest. “You’re such a dick.”\n\nGreyson glanced at Brooklyn with his dark eyes. “You better watch your mouth, Brooklyn,” he warned. “I was just with Harry, and he’s looking for you. It’d be wise to find him before he finds you.”\n\n“Tell him to piss off,” Brooklyn shrugged and looked back at Indianna just as Ace and Kal approached them, followed by a boy with blond hair that was pushed back, a few strands falling forward, grazing his high cheekbones.\n\n“Speak of the devil,” Greyson murmured, giving Brooklyn a knowing look. He turned and greeted the blond guy, who was staring at Brooklyn, who was trying her hardest to avoid eye contact.\n\n“Indianna, shall I show you to the library?” Brooklyn suggested and stepped to the side, but the blond boy was in front of her immediately, tutting and shaking his head. He placed his hands on Brooklyn’s hips and gently pushed her back onto the lockers. “Harry, I—”\n\n“You’ve been avoiding me,” he whispered and narrowed his eyes. “You know I don’t appreciate you ignoring me, babe.”\n\n“I totally haven’t been ignoring you,” Brooklyn said with a sweet smile. “Why on earth would I ignore you, Harry? You’re a total delight to be around, aren’t you? I can’t think why I would want to be away from you. Now, do me a favor, and leave me alone so I can show Indianna to the library.”\n\nThe blond boy, Harry, turned to look at Indianna, not having noticed her before. “Find your own way to the library,” he said, barely sparing her a glance, and he turned his attention back to Brooklyn, whose mouth dropped.\n\n“You can’t—” Brooklyn was cut off when Harry leaned down and kissed her. Immediately, Indianna noticed Brooklyn relaxing in Harry’s embrace, and her lips moved in sync with his. She gripped his arms, and Harry tangled his fingers in her curly hair. It was as if they had forgotten about the world around them and were entirely focused on each other.\n\nIndianna looked away, feeling awkward watching their intimate moment, and she caught Greyson rolling his eyes at the couple. They pulled apart when Kal, the ginger boy, made gagging noises and pretended to be sick.\n\n“God, I’d think you two don’t spend every night going for it—”\n\n“Kal!” Brooklyn cried, her eyes going wide. “God, stop talking!”\n\nIndianna quickly realized that no one was paying her any attention, so she slowly took a step backward, confident that she could slip away unnoticed. Greyson, however, was entirely focused on Indianna, and he noticed her immediately. He turned his head, raising his eyebrows at her.\n\n“Going somewhere, Indie?”\n\nIndianna felt her cheeks going red when all eyes went to her. This was the opposite of what she wanted.\n\n“Er… Yeah. The library. I’m just…” She took another step back and pointed behind her. “Gonna go.”\n\n“I don’t mind showing you where to go,” Brooklyn suggested kindly, stepping away from Harry.\n\n“No,” Harry interjected, his voice blunt. He wrapped his arm around Brooklyn, holding her to his chest, causing Brooklyn to narrow her eyes and elbow Harry in the stomach. “She does.” He leaned down and whispered something into Brooklyn’s ear, which made her roll her eyes, but a faint smile formed on her lips.\n\n“It’s fine,” Indianna said quickly, and she hurriedly turned around and walked away before anyone else could say anything. She pushed away the guilt she felt from being rude and focused on making her way through the crowds of students littering the cramped school corridors.\n\nIndianna felt utterly exhausted when she finally sat down in the library. She let out a long sigh and closed her eyes, basking in the calming silence of the library. For the first time today, she felt at ease, surrounded by books and the few students who went to the library during lunch. Even the scent of dust and the poor ventilation of the library soothed her.\n\nShe was alone.\n\n‘Sugar?’\n\nIndianna sighed when she heard the voice. It didn’t make her jump this time—she was expecting it, having felt the presence creep into her mind. She chose to ignore the voice.\n\n‘Indianna, don’t ignore me.’\n\nIndianna scowled. ‘Leave me alone,’ she told the voice and reached into her pocket for her phone, attempting to distract herself.\n\nThe voice didn’t give up. ‘Indianna?’\n\nIndianna shook her head and scrolled through her messages, ignoring the voice.\n\n‘Indianna!’ The voice was so loud it made Indianna’s brain rattle, and she gasped as a sharp pain seared through her head. It passed quickly, but she felt disoriented and rubbed her eyes, trying to focus properly on the world around her as she recovered from the burst of pain.\n\n‘Did you do that?’ Indianna asked the voice in her head cautiously. ‘Did you hurt me?’\n\nThere was a silence. ‘I think I did.’\n\n‘You think?!’ Indianna didn’t think it was possible to yell in her mind, but clearly it was. ‘You think?! That hurt! You hurt me!’\n\n‘I can find it hard to control my anger at times, sugar. It’d be wise to do as I say, and we can avoid that happening again in the future.’\n\n‘You hurt me because you got angry?!’ Indianna hissed. ‘What the hell is wrong with you?!’\n\n‘This is new for both of us, sugar. I didn’t plan on causing you pain, but you made me angry, and it just happened.’\n\n‘Are you even going to apologise?’\n\n‘Are you going to apologize for ignoring me?’\n\n‘That’s not fair! You’re insane! What do you want with me?’\n\n‘I can’t tell you.’\n\n‘Why the hell not?!’ Indianna was growing increasingly frustrated.\n\n‘I want to tell you, sugar—’\n\n‘Stop calling me that!’\n\n‘Don’t interrupt me. I want to tell you, but I don’t know if you are ready.’\n\nIndianna frowned and closed her eyes, rubbing her temples with her fingers. ‘Ready for what?’ she asked eventually.\n\n‘The truth.’\n\n‘What do you mean?’\n\n‘I can’t tell you until you are ready, sugar.’\n\n‘I’m scared. You’re scaring me,’ Indianna admitted. Her head was full of emotions, and she wasn’t sure what to feel. Anger? Fear? Confusion?\n\n‘I’m sorry about that, Indie. It’s not my intention.’\n\n‘Answer me one question.’\n\n‘That depends on what the question is.’\n\n‘Do you go to this school?’\n\nThe voice paused. ‘Yes, I do.’\n\n‘Are you in—’\n\n‘Only one question, sugar.’",

        "content": "“How was school?”\n\nIndianna’s mother, Iris, was by the door when Indianna arrived home after school. She was smiling kindly, but Indianna didn’t smile back. Indianna had a difficult relationship with her mother, and she was quickly growing tired of it. Iris had been a wonderful mother when Indianna was younger—she adored her and did everything she could for her.\n\nThat was until Indianna’s father died. From then on, Iris had retreated into herself and didn’t show Indianna the love or affection that she once had. She still cared about her daughter, but Indianna often felt unwanted.\n\nShe didn’t think her mother cared anymore, so on the rare days that Iris seemed to perk up and take an interest in Indianna’s life, Indianna knew it wouldn’t last. She knew that her mother would lose interest the next day or the day after, and Iris would go back to walking around the house, lost in her own mind, not talking to Indianna about anything personal. The only conversations they would have would remain basic and simple.\n\n“It was fine,” Indianna said and continued up the stairs to her new room, which was littered with cardboard boxes containing her belongings that she had yet to unpack.\n\nShe sat down on her double bed and fell back onto the soft duvet. Her eyes fluttered shut, and she sighed, her mind going back to the day. She thought of the voice in her mind and then of Greyson, before realizing that there was a pushing feeling in her head. The voice was in her head.\n\nIndianna’s eyes flew open, and she sat up, ready to prepare herself to talk to the voice—but her world started to spin as she sat up, and she raised her hand to her mouth, suddenly feeling very queasy. A wave of nausea made her gag, and heat washed over her body. She could feel sweat forming on her back already. Indianna looked across the room to the door that led to her en suite, and she cautiously rose from the bed, focusing on the door that was swaying slightly in her eyes.\n\n“Oh no,” Indianna whispered as her stomach churned, and she scrambled to the bathroom, throwing herself onto the floor by the toilet.\n\nShe gagged, and seconds later the contents of the day’s lunch were sitting in the toilet bowl, with a gasping Indianna clutching at the side of the toilet, gripping the seat tightly to hold herself up. She suddenly felt very weak, and she groaned as she was sick again. Afterward, she found herself lying back on the bathroom floor, feeling too weak to hold herself up. Her heavy eyes closed, and it wasn’t long before darkness overtook her.\n\n***\n\nIndianna woke up with a start, jolting up from the bathroom floor. Her skin was slick with sweat, and she was breathing heavily. She rubbed her eyes and pulled herself up from the floor, stumbling weakly back into her room. It was dark outside, and after checking the clock, she realized that it was morning—she had been asleep on the bathroom floor all night.\n\nIndianna sighed and returned to her bathroom, squinting at herself in the mirror when she turned the light on. Her skin was pale, and she had dark circles under her eyes, making her look as bad as she felt.\n\nShe decided to shower, hoping that the cool water would help tame her temperature and soothe the headache that was starting to form. It offered her temporary relief, but as soon as she stepped out, she felt the heat washing over her again—and she felt ten times worse than she did the previous evening.\n\nShe dried and dressed in slow motion. Any fast movement made her vision blur, and sickness formed in her stomach. She pulled a vest top over her head and stumbled, reaching out for her bed for support. Eventually, she dressed fully and fell back onto the bed, panting with effort.\n\nHer body felt like it was being engulfed in tiny needles, and she whimpered quietly, hating this feeling. She reached down for her shoes, not wanting to go to school, but she hoped that a distraction was all she needed. She was sure that she’d feel better once she was on her way to school.\n\n‘Why are you going to school? You are clearly ill, sugar.’\n\nIndianna had been waiting for the voice to say something. She had felt his presence before she fell asleep the night before, and she had felt him since she had woken up.\n\n‘You took your time to speak up.’\n\n‘Why are you going to school, sugar?’\n\n‘It’s my second day. I can’t skip it already.’\n\n‘Yes, you can, and you should.’\n\n‘No, I shouldn’t. Besides, I am not being stuck at home with my mother.’\n\n‘You don’t get along?’\n\nIndianna frowned. ‘Not really.’\n\n‘That shouldn’t be the reason you are going to school.’\n\n‘It’s not the only reason.’\n\n‘You should stay at home, sugar.’\n\n‘I’m fine. This will probably all be gone in a couple of hours.’ Indianna sounded like she wasn’t only trying to convince the voice, but herself too.\n\nThe voice scoffed. ‘It probably won’t.’\n\nIndianna ignored the voice and stood up. ‘I guess we’re going to find out.’\n\n***\n\nThe sun was shining brightly, and it was making Indianna feel worse as she walked into school that day.\n\n‘You shouldn’t have come in, sugar.’\n\n‘If you aren’t going to answer my questions, then don’t talk to me,’ Indianna was quick to reply and narrowed her eyes at the ground as she entered the school building, her temper particularly short today.\n\n“Hey, beautiful.”\n\nIndianna stopped in her tracks when a brown-haired boy appeared in front of her, and she looked up, her eyes going wide.\n\n“Are you new around here?” the boy asked, and Indianna felt extremely uncomfortable as she watched this boy’s eyes shamelessly trail up and down her body.\n\nIndianna hadn’t dressed as modestly as the day before due to her soaring temperature, but she didn’t think that her shorts and vest top were an invitation for boys to stare at her like predators.\n\n“I’m sure I would remember somebody like you,” the boy continued, smirking. He clearly thought he was charming, but Indianna just felt very wary, not liking the sleazy glint in his eyes.\n\n“Sorry,” she apologized quietly and stepped to the side. “I have somewhere I need to be.”\n\n“Where are you in a rush to?” The boy placed his hand on Indianna’s arm, and she stiffened, not liking the touch of his clammy skin on hers. “I can show you around, sweet cheeks.”\n\n“I’m good, thank you,” Indianna murmured and tried to step back, but she was suddenly pulled forward. The force at which she crashed into the boy’s chest left her slightly dazed, but his now tight hold on her arm quickly brought her back to reality.\n\n“You should be more grateful!” the boy snapped, and Indianna shrank as far away from him as she could. “A pretty little thing like you shouldn’t be left alone. There are some mean guys around here.”\n\n“G-Get off me!” Indianna whimpered, her heart pounding in her chest. She tried to push the boy away, but he was strong.\n\n“You need someone like me to look after you, darling.” There was an edge to the boy’s voice, and fear filled Indianna.\n\n“P-Please!” Indianna begged. “Please, let me go!”\n\n“You—”\n\nThe boy was cut off by a very familiar voice, and Indianna looked behind him to see Greyson. His eyes were locked onto the guy holding her, and he looked angry.\n\n“The girl asked you to let her go.”\n\nThe boy scoffed, not turning to face Greyson. “Fuck off, mate, I’m busy.”\n\nThere was a pause, and Greyson raised his eyebrows at the back of the boy’s head.\n\n“Big mistake,” he murmured, and Indianna gasped when she saw Greyson’s fingers wrap around the boy’s throat.\n\nThe boy froze, and his eyes widened in fear when he saw Greyson beside him. “Shit, man, I didn’t know it was you. I—”\n\nGreyson applied pressure to the boy’s neck, and he was cut off, gasping for air.\n\n“Let her go,” he whispered menacingly into the boy’s ear. His dark tone sent a shiver down Indianna’s spine, and he wasn’t even talking to her.\n\nImmediately, Indianna was released, and she stumbled backward, crying out in surprise when she crashed into somebody. She panicked and stumbled. She wasn’t sure if it was shock or how ill she was feeling that made her lose balance, but she was steadied by the person she had stumbled into.\n\n“Relax,” a calm voice said, and Indianna looked into the kind eyes of Greyson’s friend, Ace—the nice one. “Relax, it’s just me. I’m not going to hurt you. Are you o—”\n\nIndianna’s attention was ripped from Ace when she heard a loud crash, and she looked over at Greyson, who had thrown the boy into a row of lockers. He crumpled to the ground in pain.\n\n“Mate, I’m sorry—”\n\nGreyson grabbed the boy off the floor and shoved him up against the now dented lockers.\n\n“Don’t fucking call me mate,” Greyson hissed.\n\n“What happened?” Brooklyn appeared at Indianna’s side as a crowd started to appear around Greyson and the boy. “Are you okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost!”\n\n“I…” Indianna looked back at Greyson and cringed when he punched the boy, his strength making the boy’s nose bleed.\n\n“Apologize to her!” Greyson growled, and all eyes went to Indianna, whose eyes widened and whose skin went paler than she thought possible. “Apologize now, Josh, or I’ll make sure you won’t live to see the sun, mate! Now!”\n\n“Fuck!” the boy, Josh, shouted and pried at Greyson’s arm that was across his throat. “I’m sorry! Fuck, I’m sorry!”\n\n“I don’t think you mean it,” Greyson hissed, applying more pressure to Josh’s throat.\n\n“I do!” Josh yelled, his eyes wide with fear. “I’m sorry! I am.”\n\n“Better,” Greyson snapped, and dropped Josh to the floor. “Now get out of my sight before I do something I will not regret!”\n\nJosh was up from the floor and rushing away from Greyson within seconds, and Greyson’s eyes were immediately on Indianna. Her mouth was slightly agape, and she was staring at Greyson in shock. She didn’t think that he could be so terrifying.\n\n“What?” Greyson suddenly barked and looked around at the crowd of curious students that had formed. “Move along!”\n\n“What happened?” Brooklyn asked Indianna as the crowd started to disperse.\n\n“I…” Indianna’s eyes were locked onto Greyson’s, and she took a step backward as he started to approach them. “I… I have to go—”\n\n“Indie, wait!” Before she could turn around, Greyson grabbed her wrist, holding her gently. “Wait.”\n\n“No, no, I need to—”\n\n“I’m sorry you had to see that,” Greyson said seriously. “Josh is a sick bastard. He won’t bother you anymore.”\n\n“O-Okay,” Indianna stuttered. She wasn’t sure how to view Greyson after what she had just witnessed.\n\n“You can stop looking at me like I’m going to hurt you,” Greyson said, raising his eyebrows at Indianna.\n\nLuckily, Kal and Harry approached them before Indianna had the chance to say anything.\n\n“Dude!” Kal exclaimed, grinning at Greyson. “We heard what happened!”\n\n“What exactly did happen?” Brooklyn asked, looking around the group as Harry stood next to her and wrapped his arm around her shoulder.\n\n“Josh was being inappropriate and manhandling Indianna,” Ace explained.\n\nBrooklyn’s eyes widened. “God, he never learns! He’s such a creep! Are you okay, Indianna?”\n\nAll eyes went to Indianna, and she groaned internally. “I’m fine, thank you. I think I’m going to go.”\n\n“Indie, are you really alright?” Greyson wondered, looking Indianna up and down—but not in a sexualizing way. “You really look like shit.”\n\n“Thanks,” Indianna said bluntly.\n\n“He could have said it more politely,” Brooklyn said and gave Greyson a look, “but he’s right. You don’t look well.”\n\n“I’m fine, really,” Indianna insisted, and she turned around, walking away from the group.\n\nShe wasn’t fine. The incident had provided her with a brief distraction from how she was feeling, but now the symptoms were flooding back. Her head was thumping, she was sweating, and her whole body was aching.\n\n‘Go home, sugar, you’re ill.’\n\nIndianna groaned when she heard the voice. ‘No…’\n\n‘Go home,’ the voice repeated. ‘Now!’\n\n‘Make me.’\n\nIndianna walked into the girls’ toilets, and a sharp pain suddenly appeared in her head. She cried out in pain and clutched at a sink as it got worse.\n\n‘Stop it! Stop it, please!’",

As I’ve mentioned, I get angry easily and I can’t always control what I do when I’m angry, sugar.’\n\n‘You need to learn!’ Indianna shouted. ‘God, you can’t keep doing that!’\n\n‘Go home, and I pinkie-promise that I’ll work on it.’\n\n‘You’re crazy!’\n\n‘Go home!’\n\n‘No!’\n\n‘I won’t tell you again.’\n\n‘Tell me who you are, and I’ll go home,’ Indianna said, attempting to reason with the voice.\n\nThe voice scoffed. ‘Not happening.’\n\n‘Then I’m not going home.’\n\n‘I can make the pain worse, sugar. Don’t make me.’\n\n‘You’re blackmailing me?’ Indianna gasped.\n\n‘You are in no fit state to be at school. If blackmail is what it takes, then that’s what I’ll do.’\n\n‘You’re evil.’\n\n‘I’m trying to look out for you.’\n\n‘By hurting me?’\n\n‘Are you going to go home?’\n\n‘No,’ Indianna said stubbornly.\n\nThe pain that appeared in her head was sharp, and Indianna gasped, doubling over. It didn’t last long, and when the pain disappeared, Indianna noticed Brooklyn crouched in front of her, her eyebrows furrowed in concern.\n\n“Indianna, sweet, what’s wrong? Are you in pain?”\n\n“My head,” Indianna whimpered and groaned. She pulled herself up. “I had a really bad pain in my head.”\n\n“I have painkillers if you need them,” Brooklyn suggested.\n\n“Thank you, but no, they won’t work. It’s gone now.”\n\n‘I don’t like hurting you, sugar. I don’t want to.’\n\n‘Then don’t!’\n\n‘It’s extremely hard to control, especially when I’m trying to help you and you’re not listening.’\n\n‘Help me by leaving me alone!’\n\nIndianna groaned in frustration and rubbed her head. She refused to let the voice in her head win. She would not go home.\n\n“Maybe I should get the nurse?” Brooklyn said, looking at Indianna unsurely.\n\n“P-Please don’t, I’m fine.”\n\n“Lessons have started,” Brooklyn said softly. She took in Indianna’s appearance—it was easy to tell that she was ill. “You really don’t look well at the moment.”\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“You seem to say that a lot, sweet,” Brooklyn said. “I’m starting to think that you aren’t actually fine.”\n\n“But I am—”\n\n“No, you’re not. You’re ill. You need to go home and rest.”\n\n‘You should listen to her, she’s right. Don’t make me force you, sugar. Neither of us will like it.’\n\nIndianna sighed and nodded. “Fine, you win,” she whispered—but she wasn’t talking to Brooklyn. “I’ll go home.”\n\n***\n\nIndianna had been home for a few hours. She had spent the whole time lying on the couch in the lounge, feeling like death. She was trying to sleep when the doorbell rang, and Indianna groaned, the loud bell making her head hurt. Her mother was in the kitchen, and Indianna heard footsteps as Iris walked through the house and opened the front door.\n\n“Hello, Mrs. Hughs.”\n\nIndianna suddenly became very alert when she heard his voice.\n\n“I’m a friend of Indianna’s. I just wanted to check in and see how she was doing.”\n\n“That’s very kind of you. I’m glad she’s making friends,” Iris said. “What did you say your name was again?”\n\n“I didn’t.”\n\nThere was a silence, and then Iris spoke cautiously. “You seem awfully familiar.”\n\n“I’m sure I do.”\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n“Greyson Evans.”\n\nIris gasped, and Indianna heard a thud. “You need to leave.”\n\n“That’s not very polite, Mrs. Hughs. My foot now hurts. Why don’t you open the door fully and let me in?”\n\n“Get out,” Iris said firmly, and Indianna, surprisingly, found herself agreeing with her mother. She couldn’t face Greyson right now. She had spent the majority of her time at home comparing his voice with the one in her head. She couldn’t stop thinking about how similar they were.\n\n“Let’s have a chat, Iris,” Greyson said, talking to Iris like he knew her. Indianna heard his voice get closer, and she closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep.\n\n“Indianna is sleeping. You should leave,” Iris said as she followed Greyson into the lounge. He looked over at Indianna and then at Iris.\n\n“Please, leave—”\n\n“Sit, Iris,” Greyson commanded and took a seat. He gestured to the couch beside him.\n\n“What do you want, Greyson?” Iris asked meekly.\n\n“I want an explanation.”\n\n“You’re not getting one.”\n\n“I get what I want,” Greyson snapped. “The more I understand, the easier it will be for her.”\n\n“I can deal with her when the time comes. We don’t need your help.”\n\n“You do, Iris. This is going to happen to her very soon. She didn’t randomly get ill. It’s time.”\n\n“No, it’s too soon!” Iris gasped.\n\n“No, it’s not.”\n\n“She’s nearly eighteen. She has time—”\n\n“She does not.”\n\n“Yes, she does!” Iris said, her voice rising in panic.\n\n“Do not raise your voice at me, Iris,” Greyson warned. “I am here to help.”\n\nIris sighed and shook her head. She looked at her daughter. “We shouldn’t have come here.”\n\n“Did you really think you could help her go through this just by yourself?” Greyson asked.\n\n“Yes, I did.”\n\n“Then you are stupid,” Greyson scoffed, and Iris gasped. “You are a fool if you believed you could help her.”\n\n“How dare you—”\n\n“How dare you!” Greyson growled. “You’ve come onto my land with her, and you expect us not to bother you? It’s my duty to look after my own. Pack or not. The moment you crossed the border into this town, you signed her over to us. You can’t get her through this. She belongs with us.”\n\n“W-What? No!” Iris cried. “H-How?”\n\n“You two belong to no one. She needs a pack, and you happened to move to a town where there is a very powerful one. Mine. I can choose who I want in my pack, and when the time comes, she will join mine. You have no say in the matter, Iris.”\n\n“You can’t do that! She’s my daughter!”\n\nGreyson raised his eyebrows, shrugging his shoulders. “And?”\n\n“We’re leaving. You won’t have to worry about us. We’ll leave tomorrow.”\n\nGreyson laughed. “Don’t be a fool, Iris. If you try to leave this town, you will never see her again. I promise you that.”\n\n“You’re evil! You can’t do that!”\n\n“I’m just trying to look out for her. I’m being nice and giving you time with her, but she’s going to find it hard once the time comes, and you won’t see her as often.”\n\n“You can’t do this!” Iris pleaded.\n\n“Do not push my boundaries, Iris. You know who I am, so you know that I’m not always this nice. Accept the time I’m giving you with her.”\n\n“She’s scarred,” her mother whispered. “Please.”\n\n“Her wrist.”\n\n“Not just physically. Mentally,” Iris said. “She’s been through a lot. This is going to be too much for her. I’m guessing because you know who I am, you are aware of what happened to us?”\n\n“I am.”\n\n“The attack changed her,” Iris said. “She used to be so full of life. She was confident and so bubbly and friendly with everyone. She may have been little, but she had such a big personality. When the attack happened… she became a shell of who she was. I lost my daughter that day, Greyson. She’s not good with new people. You can’t just shove this life onto her.”\n\n“I’ll deal with her. She’ll be fine.”\n\n“She won’t. I’m her mother, and I can’t even get through to her anymore. I know I’ve not been the best over the years, but I’m trying now, but she wants nothing to do with me.”\n\n“Trust me, Iris, she’ll be fine with me. I’ll get her through this.”\n\nIris paused and narrowed her eyes at Greyson. “Why? Why are you interested in her?”\n\nGreyson looked over, and Indianna sighed. “I think you know.”\n\nIndianna twitched, and she felt both Greyson and her mother’s eyes on her.\n\n“She’s waking up,” Iris said, and Indianna knew that pretending to be asleep was over.\n\nIndianna opened her eyes and blinked, staring at Greyson, who was staring directly at her with his arms crossed over his chest.\n\n“W-What are you doing here?” she asked, sitting up on the couch.\n\n“I came to see how you were,” Greyson told her.\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“I think that’s a lie.”\n\n“Greyson, you’ve seen her. You can leave now,” Iris said. “She needs to rest.”\n\nGreyson raised his eyebrows at Iris, almost warningly, but he stood from his seat.\n\n“I hope you feel better, Indie,” he said. “I’ll see you soon.”\n\nIndianna fell back onto the couch and rubbed her eyes. She was glad that the exchange with Greyson didn’t last for long because now her head was hurting even more. She was extremely confused.\n\nIris looked at Indianna questioningly. “He’s your friend?”\n\n“No,” Indianna answered immediately, “he’s not.”\n\n“Then why would he check up on you?”\n\n“He beat a guy up today in front of me, and he must have felt bad,” Indianna shrugged.\n\n“You need to stay away from him, Indianna.”\n\n“Since when do you care about me, Mum?” Indianna snapped suddenly. “Why do you suddenly care? You’ve been distant for years. You can’t decide out of the blue to start being a decent mother again.”\n\n“I do care about you, Indianna,” Iris said softly. “Please know that.”\n\nIndianna sighed and stood up, fanning herself with her hands.\n\n“Do you?” Indianna questioned and headed for the door. “That’s nice to know.”\n\nIndianna made her way to her room and sat down on the windowsill, opening the window wide in hopes the cool air would soothe her burning skin.\n\nShe thought back on the conversation she had overheard and frowned, trying to connect the dots, but she was clueless. She so desperately wanted to sleep, but she knew that her thoughts would keep her wide awake now. She wanted answers. Her mother was hiding something from her, and Greyson knew things about Indianna that she didn’t know herself.\n\nHow?\n\nIndianna sighed when she felt pressure forming in her head, and she knew that the voice was back.\n\n‘What do you want?’ she asked before he had a chance to talk.\n\n‘That’s not a very nice greeting, sugar.’\n\n‘I’m not in the mood.’\n\n‘Well, I was going to supply you with some answers, but seeing you’re like this, I think I’ll leave it.’\n\n‘No!’ Indianna shouted. ‘What were you going to tell me?’\n\n‘It can wait.’\n\n‘Tell me!’\n\n‘Why should I, sugar?’\n\n‘Because I deserve to know something! Anything! Even my mother is keeping secrets from me! My head is all over the place, and I’m freaking out!’\n\n‘I didn’t think you were really asleep.’\n\nIndianna froze, her breath getting caught in her throat.\n\n‘It’s you. It really is you.’\n\n‘I said I’d give you some answers, sugar.’\n\nIndianna gripped the windowsill, steadying herself. She had a feeling that it was him, but she was still shocked to say his name. Indianna swallowed nervously.\n\n‘Greyson?’\n\n‘Hello, Indie.’",

Indianna shrugged her shoulders and looked to the canteen doors and frowned.\n\nDeep down, she wanted to go back to Greyson, but she was stubborn and didn’t want to give in so easily—even if it did make her ill.\n\n“Indie!” Greyson called, pushing the doors open and arching an eyebrow at her. “I’m in your head,” he scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Come on.”\n\nIndianna sighed and slowly made her way over to him, liking the way the sparks flooded her body when he wrapped his arm around her waist.\n\n“What did the bitch want?”\n\n“She wa",

        "title": "Novel review",
        "content": "You know those stories about unwanted rejects whose loved ones either died or abandoned them to drift aimlessly through the world? A worthless no one, almost invisible to other people. There is nothing spectacular about them, no grand rise from nothing to something as they dawn into adulthood.\n\nYeah, well, that’s kind of my story.\n\nMy name is Alora Dennison, and I am literally hours away from my Awakening Ceremony at the ripe old age of eighteen, with absolutely no one who gives a crap about me to be there; no support, no family, and definitely no friends. I’m a late bloomer, I guess. Not that it’s unusual in my bloodline, as almost every female in my family didn’t ‘come out’ until they hit their late teens, from what I can remember. Much like the others in the orphanage, stuck here with me. Another reason we are snubbed and left to our own devices in this hellhole they call a home.\n\nMy ceremony has me churned up inside and restlessly pacing the room I share with Vanka. She’s like me, although in all the years we’ve bunked together, I can’t say we have ever become friends of any kind. She makes it clear she doesn’t like me and, much like everyone around me, they all keep their distance. We tolerate one another, but none of us has ever bonded.\n\nI’m an orphaned no-one whose parents died in the war ten years ago against the vampires. So is she, but it didn’t warm her to me in any way. I guess because she’s from a leg of the Santo pack, and they have hated the Whyte pack since long before the war. We were feuding before the vampires united every one of us, and old scars and grudges are not something that wolves let go of quickly.\n\nWe were two small girls left with no immediate blood link guardians, put in this place for unwanted cubs to live out our days in unexceptional ways. It would have been kinder to end our misery back then than leave us to live as outcasts among our people, our own kind. Shunned because we are the shameful proof that their packs failed them. I don’t think they knew what else to do with us. So many young with no one left to care for them and raise them in our ways and seen as cursed. They were ashamed of the failings of our families, and we are the ones to carry that burden like an eternal black mark painted on our faces.\n\nI’m amazed that kids like us even get to go through with the ceremony. I mean, it’s kind of a big deal, and we are kind of not. We’re a bit like the lost boys in Neverland, except… none of us wants to stay here, and growing up is the only way out.\n\nYour Awakening is a bit like graduation, in a sense. A passing from child to adult and usually where you would find your place, rank, in the pack, and get a mate. I have no delusions that it means anything of the sort for any of us turning tonight. There are four from the unwanted home, and I hear maybe three from the packs around. Just a handful of kids trying to break free, find their path, and all in the fabulous presence of the entire ‘Packdom.’\n\nThe Packdom being the dozen or so wolf tribes from the state. They all have to convene on Shadow Rock to watch you transform fully for the first time under the first full moon of your birth month. It’s not hard to figure out when you’re ready. In the weeks running up to your birthday, you start to change in small ways, and, goddamn, it hurts like having your insides snapped and stretched in fits of severe twisting pain and zero control over it happening.\n\nThe signs are pretty clear to all. Kind of like puberty for werewolves, I guess. Maturing, physical improvements, and a massive rise in appetite and aggression. Little moments where you start to transform painfully, and then it dissipates as quickly, so you never really reach the first transition, but it’s reported, and no one can hide it. The pain you know will come with the first time; it’s saved for the full moon after your birthday.\n\nSome don’t go through it until later in life, and some earlier. Usually, it is a sign of where you stand in the hierarchy when you turn. According to the Santo elders, the longer it takes, the weaker your DNA, but my parents never mentioned it when I was young. So, being eighteen puts me way down on the pecking order and confirms my bloodline was not that of warriors or strong enough to be anything of importance. Vanka is sixteen, and she too is turning tonight, but with Santo’s blood somewhere in her veins, she should have turned far earlier. I guess whatever mix is in her is why they reject her as one of their own.\n\nI mean, look at the Santos. They are the reigning pack in the state, and everyone in their bloodline turned before ten. Colton, the next heir as Alpha, is nineteen years old, lords over all in our kingdom, and he has been running with the pack since he was a mere eight years old.\n\nEvery single one of his family returned from the wars, which speaks volumes about the purity of their genes, strength, and abilities in battle. He’s destined to take over from his father as Alpha one day, and the way things are heading, he won’t just be Alpha of the Santo pack, but all of us. Something that has never happened in our lifetime but will begin a new dawn in how the packs live.\n\nSanto is not a nice guy. None of them are. He walks around surrounded by his sub pack, looks down at the likes of us, and never makes eye contact or responds to anyone below his station. That’s how it works here. Dominance and strength are everything to wolves. He has his father’s arrogance, and he knows that every female hitting puberty is craving to become his mate. He hasn’t officially paired or marked yet, and despite having the same girl always by his side, he’s fair game until he does.\n\nFaultlessly good-looking in that dark Latino, pretty boy way with far too handsome a face. He’s over six feet of muscle and radiates aggression without trying, and is a rare black-furred wolf on turning, one of the largest among us. I think the one time he acknowledged my existence was the day he pushed me out of his way in passing. I tripped in front of him in the hallway to the great hall, and he didn’t bat an eye or miss a step in shoving me back aggressively like I was a lightweight piece of trash. All the girls laughed at me when I landed on my ass and skidded back into the trashcan, and I’ve made sure to never get in his way again.\n\nNot that we have much time in the same place. I live in the orphanage and go to the school built purely for our kind, away from ‘normal’ people. He was ahead of me by one year, so we didn’t often cross paths in all that time, and since he lives with his pack on the south side of the mountain, only coming to the shadowy north when required, I never see him or any of his subordinates. Like all the rest of the people who avoid the ‘Rejects.’\n\nAfter the Great War, our people moved from all surrounding areas and convened nearer the mountain. Keeping close to stay protected and no one ever left again. His father is the unofficial Dominant Alpha and likes to check in with all on the mountain when he sees fit. Since Colton graduated from school, we only see him for official visits at his father’s side. Lording over their newfound kingdom of obedient and submissive packs, keeping law and order.\n\nRumor has it the vampires have been brewing and gathering for several months, maybe even years, to regain numbers and launch a new war on our kind. We always knew they would. I mean, we won the battle, but we didn’t defeat them in the way we wanted. Many survived and fled and have been out there for almost ten years, recovering from it and licking their wounds. It’s been quiet for so long, eerily so, but there is so much unease and unrest in the air that the packs called together a meeting a month back to decide the fate of our future. Trouble stirring, and we could all feel it, our senses on high alert and that vibe that something huge was coming. They think coming together to create one pack and one unity is the answer to a brewing war. Not that it changes much, as we have been living almost that way for a decade.\n\nWe were never united before under one Alpha, though. We fought as separate packs, and it almost wiped us out. There was no leadership, and it meant packs like mine, known for peaceful living and farming, were virtually annihilated. Many of our kin never returned, and it forever changed those who did. Those like me, who lost everyone, my parents, grandparents, uncles, and my brother, are shunned by people who like to pretend it never happened. My family was lost, none of them came back, and therefore, in the eyes of the pack hierarchy… my bloodline is weak. They don’t want to claim us as their kind anymore, and they sure as hell don’t want us procreating and spreading our genes to future wolves.\n\nWarriors came home. The weak did not.",

        "content": "We were never ready for it.\n\nThey were farmers; they were peaceful and had never had to fight in their lives. Like human legends and stories dictate, not all wolves are savage killing machines or feral beasts. Some are quiet, land-loving people who never want to experience the thrill of a hunt or the warm blood of another being in raw savagery. In a whirlwind of months, we were dragged into a battle to the death, and children were left in the care of the old and frail or the pregnant.\n\nWe waited endlessly to find out who of our loved ones would come home to us until one lone night. When the people who cared for me in their absence, the last of the Whytes who were too vulnerable to follow them, were slaughtered by invading vampires in our own homes. On the far edge of the farmlands, I was a lone survivor who was then shunted to the orphanage. The events of that night are so foggy and hazy. I don’t really remember it or why I was even spared. I was just a child.\n\nI still remember the agony of the day I watched others return en masse, the battle truly over with the vampires in retreat, and no one, not a single person from my bloodline, came home. An entire pack of over forty people I called my own was all gone, everything I knew… every single last one of them. I was all alone.\n\nThere is no pain compared to an eight-year-old child learning that everyone she ever loved and was protected by was never coming home for her. My security was shattered and my future dead, and all I have known since was the isolation and solitude of being one of the many who were thrown here to rot.\n\nSo now here we are, a house full of teens who bear the only living connection to our past loved ones. A mixed bunch of leftovers, but no one in the packs will bond to us for fear of producing weaker offspring. It’s all about dominance in our world and power, standing, and ability. DNA is everything. They call us the Reject Pack, which sums up exactly why we are overlooked.\n\nWe don’t belong to anyone anymore, even though by rights we should be part of the united wolf community, this new singular pack location bonds us after all. We’re not, though; they see us as cursed children and deny our mere existence, throwing us to the dark-shaded side of the mountain, so they don’t have to see us. This house is the only home we know now, and the people who care for us do so out of duty but not love. They’re afraid we curse them by proximity.\n\nIt’s forbidden to abandon a pack child, even if they come from a shamed bloodline. The Fates and traditions have laws and rules from old that we have to abide by, and abandoning the vulnerable is abhorrent. So, we are given a home, shelter, food, and education. Basic care on the understanding that we get to leave upon our awakening. Severed like a rotting limb.\n\nWe can go out, find our path, and fend for ourselves. Turning gives us gifts and abilities to go it alone. Find a pack who wants us, if that is even possible. Solves their problem and shirks off any responsibility they have for us, which sucks if you happen to turn at a young age while caught here with us.\n\nSo, that’s where I am now. Just a mere four hours before we have to climb to Shadow Rock for the full moon, and I’ll transform for the first time in my life. Changing from child to woman and my gifts will manifest along with the first emerging of my entire wolf self and whatever that will look like. Not that I have any clue what those will be if any at all. Not all of us have a special gift, and it’s unlikely I will. My parents never talked of theirs.\n\nI’ve watched this ceremony once a month for many years, and it still terrifies me to know I will be one of them. Finally, standing in the center, terrified of what the new light will bring. It’s a blood moon tonight, meant to be symbolic or biblical or some nonsense. Signaling the end of times. Not that I paid attention to our lunar studies, as they held little importance to me.\n\nWith a first transformation comes pain and a lot of it. It’s inevitable. You hear the cracking of bones, the tearing of flesh, and the howling of those going through it, haunting you for eternity. It’s awful to see, it traumatized me the first time as I was still so young, but they tell us it only hurts that way the first time. After, we’ll be different, and the pain will be far less clawing because we can heal and withstand it so much more as a stronger breed.\n\nI’ve seen it. Physical improvement, they call it. It’s the leaving of childlike features behind, firming up, muscling over as though somehow you get an injection of superhuman enhancement. All who have turned become superior in every way, even in terms of attractiveness, which explains why most females consider ‘Lord’ Colton, a god. His genes are strong.\n\nNot that I want to change. I’m already tall, slim, and athletic, and I wouldn’t say I was ugly. I’m on the pretty side of plain, with full lips, mousy brown hair, and abnormally green eyes. I take after my mother, and when I look in the mirror, I’m haunted by her memory in the most bittersweet way. Proud to carry her face with me but broken that it reminds me of what I’ve lost.\n\nI guess I am what one would call a ‘girl next door,’ but it’s another flaw in my genetic makeup.\n\nThe Alphas are all handsome or beautiful and physically perfect. You can’t deny good genes when it’s shown in every single little way. Compared to humans, they are like gods among men.\n\nNow all I can do is wait.\n\nShower, dress, brush my hair, and pace like a maniac as I watch the clock and count down the minutes to the first moon of my new future.\n\nThis could be the first step in changing everything.\n\nI can leave after tonight; I can walk away from this mountain and the people who treat us like we are nothing. I’ll be free to run far away, with no bond to anyone or anything. No one to care if I never return.\n\nI need to get through it first, and then it’s the start of a whole new existence for me.",

        "content": "My blood is rushing through my head to the point I have a headache, palms sweaty, and adrenaline spiking as I follow the path to the top of the cliff on Jell-O legs. Walking in behind the others, like me, who are to go through the ceremony at the highest point of the full moon. I’m breathless, fighting nausea and internal shaking of fear, body trembling, as I watch where I step a little too closely and almost collide with the girl in front of me. Staggering sideways and kicking stones in my path, accidentally, to avoid her.\n\n“Watch where you’re going, reject!” The growl of one of our accompanying mentors hits me in the side of the face with an open palm as he leans in close and shoves me back in line harshly. Hard enough to send me crashing into the rock face we are brushing up against, and I almost hit the ground with the force, coughing out a whimper of pain. I catch myself, right my body quickly, ignoring the burning pain of abrasions, and skip two steps to catch up and get back in line while rubbing my bruised arm and shoulder from the collision. Trying not to look his way, knowing if I do, he will probably smack me in the face for showing zero respect to a superior.\n\nOne of the Alpha’s prominent pack leaders of the subs, one of the Santos. He’s called Raymond, and he’s around twenty-four. He hates anything to do with us. Another superior wolf from a pure bloodline who sees us as an inconvenience and unworthy to breathe his air.\n\nThis is the reality of my life and how little value I have in this hierarchy. Reject is the name for all of us like we don’t have separate identities anymore, and I can’t wait to be free of these people and this life.\n\n“Halt!” A booming low, and gravelly voice ahead of us stops us all in our tracks as we come to the level top of the cliff known as ‘Shadow Rock.’ It’s more of a large plateau than a rock, but the sun never seems to lay its light and warmth in this nook of the mountain, and yet it gives us a direct and uninterrupted view of the moon every night. It’s been the point of this ceremony for hundreds of years, and we’re finally here.\n\nI pull myself past the girl in front of me and come to her side to gaze at the familiar scene before us. My stomach churning with the knowledge it’s happening. The ceremonial set up of flares and burning fires at points near the ledge are already there and glowing bright, all the way around the curve of this giant platform. Creating a red and amber glow that illuminates the space in what will soon be the wall-to-wall darkness of this still night. The center of the clearing is marked out with symbols in chalk, and a large set of circles surrounds them, one for each of those who are to awaken. I shudder inside as reality hits home that this is it, and I have nowhere to hide. You can’t outrun it; there’s no way to stop it from happening.\n\n“Clothes off here and put these on.” Scratchy gray blankets are thrust into our arms by a tall, muscular Santo, looking down at us with almost black eyes as he snarls his contempt. Walking past as he dishes them out, I am aware that many have gathered around the ledges and above us on the cliffs’ edges to watch this. Probably annoyed that they even allow my kind to go through this as everyone else does.\n\nAll the packs are here already, and right in the middle stands Juan Santo and his immediates. His second in command, his third, and his son, Colton. The ceremonial Shaman, in full dress, is standing with his staff, awaiting the start of his duties. Something he could do with his eyes closed, I expect, as he has been here for so many years.\n\nI don’t wait to question the order, eyes down, nerves frayed, but get to it. I know the drill. I throw it around my shoulders to conceal my body as best I can, the same as the others, and we quickly strip down inside our coverings with haste. Discarding our things into neat piles that we’ll return to later.\n\nTransforming rips your clothes to shreds, so being naked is the best way to deal with it. Afterward, we’ll be able to get dressed again, but this itchy old blanket is all I have to cover my modesty for now. Not that anyone cares. Nudity among wolves is common and not something they stare at or find abnormal. So many turn in the blink of an eye and come walking back in human form with no covering at all. It’s another sign of weakness to be body shy and hide if you have to go home without clothes.\n\nThe Alpha types walk around in the nude without worrying, seeing they are physically perfect. The only time it’s an issue is if a mate is being ogled by someone who isn’t hers. Males are territorial, jealous, and aggressively unpredictable when mated up, so it’s typical for regular testosterone fights over looking at each other’s women.\n\nIt’s kind of basic and primal and another reason I won’t miss being part of a pack. We’re animals by nature, and humans would be disturbed by what is standard among us. I mean, aggression, physical hostility, and even beating each other are not viewed in the same way humans would between married people. Mates fight, sometimes in wolf form, and bites and scratches are usually the best way to resolve disputes.\n\nI undress fast and leave my clothes and shoes in a neat pile between my ankles to stand up, pulling my blanket around me snugly to await the following orders and shield myself from the cool air. Visibly shaking with nerves, I glance around me quickly to see the others’ similar fear, pale skin, and solemn faces. I’m not the only one who is terrified. We’ve all seen how bad this gets, and before the night is out, we will have felt pain incomparable to anything we’ve been through in our lives.\n\n“Move!” Raymond shoves the male to my left to make him lead the way, and we dutifully follow silently, in a line, to the open clearing and head towards the chalk circles awaiting us. I close my eyes for a second and try to swallow the clawing fear spreading through my veins like ice, my throat dry and itchy with the effort. Holding myself together, I quickly move to the first circle I see as the line in front of me dissipates. Hundreds of eyes are on us as they watch and wait. Silence eery in the oncoming night, and I look up to the sky to find some sort of eternal calm. The moon will be upon us soon enough. Soon it will be dark and dotted with twinkling stars, but for now, it’s daylight, and we have to begin.\n\nAfter everyone shuffles quickly into place and settles, the booming voice of the Shaman breaks the hush as he gestures for us all to sit while he raises his staff. I do as I am told, slide down quickly, and sit cross-legged within my blanket on the cold, hard, gritty ground beneath me. Trying to get enough of the covering underneath me to make it less uncomfortable. I’m aware of the penetrating stares from all around, and I try to blot them all out.\n\n“Drink.” Something hard shunts me in my ribs from behind, and I strangle a yelp, sitting upright sharply, and spin my head around to see a wooden cup held out to me. Another Santo shoves it into my hand as I unravel it out to take it.\n\n“What’s it for?” I ask innocently, always wondering when we watched from a distance and stupidly naïve to think I’ll get any sense from one of them.\n\n“Drink it and find out,” he smirks, walking away with no actual answer.",

        "content": "I sigh, internally irritated at his attitude, before staring down at the dark amber liquid contained within, its heavy scent of herbs and perfumes wafting up into my face. I spot the others drinking it down fast, without question, and I follow suit.\n\nIt tastes like thick gloopy honey, laced with chemicals that burn my throat as I take it down and almost choke on its thicker consistency. I gag but manage to claw myself into staying still and swallowing hard with multiple gulps. Closing my eyes as the taste turns bitter, spreading down my throat and into my stomach, immediately warming them both. I can feel it disperse into my veins and limbs, knocking the cold of the rocks away from anywhere my skin touches, and almost immediately, I get a little dizzy. The ground around me moving and swaying softly, like the sea coming in on the tide.\n\nI shake my head, but it’s completely pointless. Hunching forward so I don’t fall over, I now understand why every time I watched this, the newest to awaken would sit the whole ceremony slumped down and immobile until they turned. Seemingly oblivious to all the tradition and its stages, the light faded to dark. They have dr**ged us for the pain, and I start to lose track of everything around me as a veil of surreal sweeps up like a warm fluffy fog and devours me whole.\n\nI don’t know how long we are this way or what’s happening, as all I can hear is the chant of the Shaman as he dances around, shaking things, singing, and clapping. Vision blurry and coming in waves, my body heavy yet detached, and I no longer feel like I am here or even conscious. Time passes, but I have no clue how fast or slow, and all I know is it gets dark so quickly around me, and I can’t seem to stop myself from drifting into space or losing track and fading away. Cocooning me into the little bubble of black space around me, where the smell of fire and incense makes me giddy and sleepy. It’s peaceful, yet somehow it’s not, and there’s a stirring of awareness and fear almost out of reach.\n\nLulling into a weird semi-sleep state, I can no longer open my eyes or understand what is going on around me. There are warm hands on me, maybe, but I’m not sure. The sudden breeze, although it does nothing to cool my eternal warmth.\n\nCold liquid and wrinkled hands, as something is smeared across my forehead, making me cringe with a second of reality, and I grasp to focus on the dancing form in front of me. Rattling, blowing smoke, chanting a song as it runs down the bridge of my nose, and I pull from memory that the new turns are marked with a fresh blood kill to prepare for their turn. My face will bear the mark of a wolf from an animal our Alpha will have slaughtered.\n\nThe roughness of something pulling across my skin startles me slightly, and then suddenly, I’m levitating out flat or floating, or maybe lying down. No clue anymore. I’ve never felt anything close to this, not even being drunk for the first time a few months ago when we found some alcohol in the orphanage storage cupboard. I’m too wasted to know what my body is doing, and the heavy, loud tones of the wolf song echo across the mountain as the packs sing to welcome our moon.\n\nThe memory of witnessing this many times reminds me they take them and pull the blankets free for the turning, laying them down to be blessed by the full moon, and logically, a part of my brain is telling me this is what is happening. It’s almost like I’m no longer attached to my limbs as warm sensation trails firmly across my cheek. A raspy voice comes through the fog at me.\n\n“It’s going to hurt… I can’t wait to watch it, Reject. Or maybe I might take advantage of you like this. Finally, get my way.” I barely recognize the voice, but gut instinct tells me it’s Damon, a boy from the Conran pack who tried to kiss me a year ago. He cornered me in the school hallway, pushed me against the wall, and tried to force me to kiss him while shoving his hand up my dress. I fought him off, leaving him with a nice scratch down his smarmy face, and he has been gunning for me ever since. Not that I marked him badly, we heal fast, but I left a dent in his pride and ego.\n\nI can’t react, and as a hot invasive sensation moves down my shoulder, I can only squirm, wanting so badly to get his hands off me. He’s not that dumb, though, and with all eyes on us, he leaves me alone to my fate as I try to fight to come back to a sense of now. Suddenly afraid that he will be the one to tend to me like this after this is done. Responsible for ushering me back to my clothes and the concealed shadow of the cliff edge. Who knows what he will do? I don’t recall if the turning takes you out of the dr*g-induced stupor when it’s done or not.\n\nI can’t dwell on it any longer as a burning light hits me hard over my entire body surface, almost like a blowtorch was turned on, and I spasm instinctively into an arched position on the floor. Every inch of my skin bubbling and blistering to searing levels of torture as though I have been set alight and I strain and claw the ground beneath me, gasping with effort. Breaking nails on rough terrain as I scramble for relief and yet can do nothing but scream.\n\nCrying out in pain, writhing in agony, as an intense sensation rips my skin from my bones and engulfs me. My voice deepens, scraping and hoarse like I’m swallowing splinters, and cries become growls, my throat almost bursting into flames with the effort. For a second, it’s like I’m being strangled. I’m under attack. My body is being ravaged, twisted, snapped, and slain, but this isn’t another wolf… this is the turning. It’s so much worse than I ever imagined it could be.\n\nCracking, convulsing, and devastating agony rip through me hellishly. Sending me rolling around to relieve the pain as grime, rocks, and dust scrape at my flesh and burn as I graze across them. I whimper and moan, but it eases nothing of the torture of my body crunching and shredding itself apart. I cry out, beg for my mother to save me, wail for the Fates to stop this, and claw at the rocks, breaking fingers with the sheer force of my fight and gouging what’s left of my skin on sharp edges underneath me.\n\nNo one could prepare me for what this feels like, and I’m being turned inside out while slow-roasted over an open bed of hot coals. I can’t breathe, I can’t scream anymore, and silently, I writhe and jerk and twist and turn as I am consumed by hell.\n\nOur noises are drowned out by the stamping, chanting, and clapping of the packs, thundering through the ground and reverberating through my broken, smashed body, giving way to howls as the moon reaches its peak. They encourage us to make the final transition to become like them. Combining to howl, under strict orders that none are to transform tonight and break the ceremony. Only the new shall change tonight. Only our blood will spill as our human form is destroyed to build something better.\n\nI want to die.\n\nThe pain is unbearable, driving me to the brink of insanity, and it truly feels like my human self is being tortured to nonexistence. Every bone in my body snaps and reforms as though it’s being done manually, one at a time. My flesh tears free and pulls away from the muscle. I’m wet, a hot pouring out as blood drains from the hellish self-inflicted wounds that seem to last forever, covering me in sticky warm heat, smothering me, and leaving a vile metallic scent. I can’t tell what’s sweat, blood, or maybe other kinds of fluid. I howl and strain with all my might, so I extend my face up into the air and gasp with relief as my lungs inhale and I finally take a breath. Barely holding on, reaching a pinnacle where my mind is on the verge of collapse, and the dregs of sanity teeter on a cliff edge.\n\nAnd then… everything is still.",

        "content": "It all stops. Like having a cold drink poured over scorched sunburn, instant soothing hits hard and intensely as my noise becomes silent, my burns become cool, and my breaks become one.\n\nI stop fighting my body. I am aware of the immediate cease of all of it and the eerie quiet that surrounds me so suddenly. The unnatural silence. Hazy and blurry as my head spins, and I grasp for some sense of reality. Catching my breath, gulping in cool air, and calming ambiance as the fog clears, my vision returns only slightly.\n\nI try to get up, right myself, although it feels different and stumble sideways with a disorientated sense of uprightness. I’m on my hands and knees even though I don’t know how I got this way. I can’t stand or push myself up as I would because it all feels strange, and I blink and shake my head to clear my eyes enough to see which way up I’m facing. I blink, my eyes watering, as finally, dry is restored to moist, and I see forms and shapes and shadows which then define details and more. Confused, yet there is a calm taking over me, a sense of serene with heightened senses in every way.\n\nI gaze down, and I see paws that startle me at first. Gasping at the closeness and realizing they are mine, where my hands should be, flat on the ground. Large, clawed but strong paws, bigger than I thought they would be. I lift one and shake it, almost as if I need to convince myself that I can use and control this limb. It’s genuinely connected to my body. My legs are solid, with thick silver-gray fur up my muscular chest. I have a streak of purest snow white that travels as far as I can see. I stare at it, lean back, and pull my chin in tight to follow it until I can’t strain any further to see.\n\nI have very little memory of my mother in her true form, but I know this is from her. She was a white and my father a silver, yet it’s rare to combine both in such a way. Most wolves are brown or gray… white is a mutation that’s almost unheard of, and my mother used to try to hide because it brought only stares.\n\nStaggering on strange legs and fall flat, splaying out and bumping my undercarriage as I collide with stone. I shake my head, the unfamiliar weight of a different form pulling me from side to side, not entirely in control of my limbs or movements yet, but aware it’s so much bigger than my human skull. Aware, suddenly, of the scene around me coming back into focus and realizing we are still being watched. Sobering fast as my new metabolism pushes the last dr*gs out of my system and cleanses my blood.\n\nThe atmosphere is charged, and I’m surrounded by newly changed wolves of all shades of gray and brown, although I’m the only one with white in my coat. Turning as the Shaman’s chants draw my eyes back to him, I trip over my uncoordinated self as I try to right myself and get up. It’s hard to use my hands as front legs, and I instinctively rear backward too far onto my haunches, lose my balance, and reel forward again to correct it before tumbling face on. I slump to the ground once more and meet the dust with a lower jaw clunk.\n\n“It gets easier. Try to stay on your feet. All four of them.” The voice above me pulls my head to tilt towards it, and I recoil as I realize Colton Santo is standing right by me, watching as I make a spectacle of myself falling flat out on new legs. I don’t know if I’m shocked that he spoke to me or wary that he did.\n\nI’ve never trusted anything about him or any of his motives and wonder when he got so close here. Avoiding looking directly at him, keeping my eyes averted from his, attempting to get to grips with this weird body and focusing on learning to use it. All I can do is whimper back, realizing I can’t form words this way, and go into my head link instinctively.\n\nWe don’t have the vocal cords for human talking. Wolves in the same pack have a connection mentally, so they can communicate without talking, which, admittedly, is impossible for a wolf. It’s also possible when close enough to speak to one, not from your pack, if they are willing to hear you.\n\nIt feels strange.\n\nI attempt to link with him, weirded out by this new, almost natural ability I didn’t have before. I am overwhelmed by all of this and not sure if I am still heavily dr**ged when in this form or if this surreal new way to experience everything is wolf’s sense. Things affect us differently as humans, and this disorientation might be something I have to adjust to.\n\nYeah, well, walk it off. Learn fast.\n\nHe links me back, a husky familiarity to his voice inside my head that does strange things to my stomach. It’s hardly a polite response, and the tone tells me he doesn’t want to communicate with me, especially not in a head link.\n\nI’m not one of his pack, and I’m not even on the same level as him. It’s disrespectful to try. He walks off towards his father to further demonstrate the point, and I flop down to get to grips with everything I got hit with. I’m heavy, unsure how to navigate my dog’s body when I’ve spent my life walking on two legs. I must weigh four times my average weight for sure, although the size of my paws suggests maybe even more.\n\n“The turning will not last… only fleeting moments for your first time. You will be awoken when you come out, and your path will lead you to your destiny. Pay attention, be alert. You are now on the other side.” The Shaman states it loudly, and his voice echoes around the mountain like a prophetic song. I have heard it so many times, yet it finally means something to me this time.\n\nI get up on unsure legs, slowly, like Bambi on newborn limbs, and lift my head as I know I’m meant to. In unison with all around me, we stretch our necks out, lift our noses to the heavens, and howl at the moon for the first time in our lives as one united pack; no matter who we are, where we are from, whatever our bloodline or our past, long and soulful with meaning. United in one song that completes our transformation. A sound that echoes around us, through us, is joined by the hundreds who watch until we fill the night sky with a low, eerie hum that will reverberate around the mountains and put the fear of God into the wildlife.\n\nIt feels strange at first. My throat vibrates; it aches and rasps my vocal cords, but as my belly empties, my air departs, and the longest yowl comes cascading out of me until it scratches my throat and leaves me breathless. I feel alive. Like I have been holding my breath and waiting for this my whole life. I guess I have. This is what I was born to be, and with the awakening comes freedom.\n\nI can leave.\n\nI can run.\n\nI can live off the land and hunt to survive. The confines of humans no longer bind me to get by. Wolves can live anywhere as long as they can hunt, and although we have a pack mentality, I’ve heard stories of isolated wolves doing fine on their own. That is what I have planned, longed for, waited for, and I know where I’m heading. I can finally realize my dream of leaving all of this behind me and finding my solitary peace somewhere out there. As far away from these mountains and people as I can, and never looking back.",

It’s fast, almost instant, and before I can blink or even get to grips with what is happening, I am nakedly human. Smeared in my blood and flat out in a huddled heap on the floor, saving me some of my dignity by shielding my body.\n\nI scramble to pull my body into a ball, aware I am entirely uncovered and exposed to the hundreds of eyes around me.

I’ve no idea what’s happened, why there’s no light anymore, or why I’m so messed up, dazed and confused, and my body aches badly.\n\nThe air is filled with noises so terrifying I freeze in utter fear as they filter through, and I pick them apart, stilled as I listen and try to make sense of what they are. My heart gripped in icy terror.\n\nScreaming, howling. Wails of despair and sobbing. Something else, too, a weird, almost chatter-like taunting noise that I swear is precisely how I would imagine the devil would sound laughing. It sends the fear of God through me, and I shudder violently, pu",

        "title": "Chapter 1. Her Birthday",
        "content": "Rihanna's POV\n\nIt was the Princess's birthday; she lived another year to cause hell for me.\n\nThe decorations of pink and white in the ballroom sickened me. They always had, actually. They reminded me of the worst year of my life, reoccurring.\n\nI was nine years old then, wearing a cute red ball gown, with my head adorned with light jewelry and a gold necklace belonging to my mom.\n\nPrincess Vanessa was having her tenth birthday, and the ballroom was filled with white and pink designs.\n\nI crept towards the long table where meals of different cultures and origins were laid alongside cocktails and wines.\n\nI raised my legs to where her cake was kept on the highest table and gleamed wickedly at it.\n\nMy twin brother, Raymond, was in charge of keeping the little pups away from the table, but he was far off outside the ballroom, watching the Alpha King invite the guests.\n\nI knew my brother would get in trouble for what I was about to do, but I had to do it. Princess Vanessa owed me everything.\n\nI slapped down the cake, spreading it across the table. It made a melting sound, and the high steps toppled to the ground.\n\nInside of me, I felt bad ruining it, but this was revenge. I was being petty, but that was all nine-year-old me could think of.\n\nHearing footsteps from outside the ballroom, I envisioned the Luna Queen and the servants coming.\n\nI had shifted early, and so had my wolf. She told me to run away, but I stubbornly didn't. I didn't care—I wanted them to see me. I wanted Princess Vanessa to see me. I ruined her cake!\n\nBut Raymond appeared. His expression went from surprise to anger and then fear. He pulled me by the ear, but I slapped his hands off.\n\n\"Serves Princess Vanessa right!\"\n\nMy voice was small and light, so I made a noise shouting like that.\n\n\"And you'd be served a punishment soon…\" he barely finished when our Luna Queen walked into the kitchen.\n\nShe wore a smile on her lips, which was also smeared bright red, matching her auburn hair.\n\nHer bright green eyes darkened on seeing the ruined cake. She pinched her skin through her white dress, wanting everything to be a dream.\n\nSlowly, with a glare, she turned to my brother and me. Her eyes rested on my cake-stained dress. I quickly cleaned it off, scared as her strong aura filled the room.\n\n\"Rihanna, no!\" she tried dragging my hair, but Raymond pushed me aside. She grabbed him and yanked his hair, but I quickly bit her hands.\n\nShe flung me easily, and her claws crawled from their place, piercing my brother's neck. I knew I let her Luna wolf out. And it wouldn't be easy to control.\n\nI began screaming while throwing cake at her. She was very annoyed that I was ruining her dress, but I still didn't care.\n\nI hated her like I hated her daughter. My mother rushed in, running with her blue stilettos that I felt would break any minute.\n\nA victorious smirk was etched on my face as all the guests came in, seeing the cake and the Luna Queen. Even Princess Vanessa came in, and my wolf began laughing.\n\n\"Raymond, who did this!\" my father barked. He was the Beta of our Kingdom. He looked scary, towering down at my brother in his black suit.\n\nBut why did he care who did it? Couldn't he see the Luna Queen almost killing his son?\n\nThe Alpha King pushed my father aside and came in front. His expression changed to something different.\n\nThe guests came closer one by one, eyeing the melted cake on the ground. I noticed a guest, Duchess Vivian, wearing an impressed smirk. But then Princess Vanessa burst into a wail.\n\nI couldn't help it and laughed along with Lana, my wolf. Everyone turned to me, and Raymond looked scared. I shook my head hard while laughing so much that a piece of jewelry fell off.\n\nThey all must have seen the cake stained on me. I laughed like a mad wolf despite everyone looking at me.\n\n\"I pushed Rihanna to the cake. It's my fault,\" Raymond shouted as the Alpha King advanced toward me. I stopped laughing.\n\nMy mother narrowed her eyes at him. \"Raymond, she's the one with cake on her dress…\"\n\n\"But I pushed her to it, Mom,\" he repeated.\n\nHe was a mood spoiler. Why was he taking the blame? What would they do knowing I did it? The Luna Queen's hands were tightened on him.\n\n\"What did Princess Vanessa do to you?\" she roared. Everyone stood watching. She was strangling him, and no one said anything?\n\nI charged at her and headbutted her in the stomach. She staggered and threw me by my hair. Mom held onto Raymond, whom she dropped.\n\n\"Sam, what's wrong with your children!\" the Alpha King screamed at my father.\n\nI wanted to yell at him back and ask what was wrong with his wife.\n\nTrying to overpower the Luna was effortless, so I bit her hand numerous times. I was an animal, I knew. But her daughter was a witch and a bully.\n\nThe servants fought and dragged me away from her, panting breathlessly.\n\n\"Please, let her go. I messed up the cake, not her!\" Raymond stuttered. His small suit was already stained with dirt.\n\nHis dark hair had sand mixed with it. I glared at him and the Luna Queen.\n\n\"Shut up. I did it. Princess Vanessa, I am so happy to see you cry!\" I screamed, to everyone's horror.\n\nRaymond pushed me down, and I fell on the cake. He repeated his claim of messing up the cake. What was he so scared of? Why was he protecting me?\n\n\"Raymond? Rihanna? Who messed up this cake and why?\" my father asked calmly.\n\nWith Raymond behind me, he gave me a sign with his fingers not to speak. I grumpily obeyed.\n\n\"I did, Dad. It was an accident. Rihanna annoyed me, so I pushed her to it. That's why she had cake on her body…\"\n\n\"And not on her hair? And everywhere on her hands? You're lying!\" Princess Vanessa cried.\n\nHer little eye mascara was drooping with her tears, staining her white ball gown. Her mother sighed and dragged her away from us.\n\nMy mother looked at me disappointedly. They surely knew it was me. Raymond was never reckless; that's why he was asked to watch the cake. I was the little witch around the house.\n\nBut since Raymond agreed to the crime, he was punished. And I didn't know that could happen.\n\nWhy was Princess Vanessa's cake so precious?\n\nMy brother was given fifteen strokes for it! Who dared give the Beta's son strokes? Of course, the Luna.\n\nI was so upset, but when I heard it was the Alpha King himself, I slid low. I hated everyone here.\n\nPrincess Vanessa had earlier annoyed me by calling my father a stupid dog who only listened to her father without having a will of his own.\n\nI reported to the Delta, but she wasn't punished.\n\nThe Delta's excuse was it was her birthday, so no one would be punished. Yet my brother was flogged before the celebration began.\n\nMy hatred for Princess Vanessa increased, but in return, the whole pack hated me. They didn't like my confidence to stand up for myself. Or my mischievousness.\n\nThey cursed at me, saying I was the reason for my brother's scarred back. And no one played with me. I didn't mind until I finally began to.\n\nMy mother hated me, and I became an embarrassment to my father. All I wanted was payback to Princess Vanessa, who insulted my father.\n\nI revenged in the most painful way I could think of as a child, but my actions kept on haunting me.\n\nPrincess Vanessa occasionally spread lies against me, that I destroyed one thing or the other, and people believed and hated me more. I became timid.\n\nI had cooled down, but the name and hatred never left me. I was now diminutive due to a lack of love and care. I didn't have confidence left.\n\nI was the most hated in the pack, all thanks to Princess Vanessa.\n\nHer birthday had come again, and suddenly, some rush of energy, confidence, and mischievousness.\n\nMy wolf, Lana, was with me so I wouldn't be beaten down so easily. I always remembered my sad story on all her birthdays.\n\nToday, she was to find her mate, and that smelt like more trouble for me. I stood far away.\n\nWe were at the open field and not the ballroom. All Princess Vanessa's friends couldn't fit. I stayed far away so I wouldn't get accused of something again.\n\nAll the guests gathered around her, some important members of our kingdom as well.\n\nOur kingdom was a group of packs, with ours—Black Hills—being the most powerful. Hence our Alpha being the King.\n\nI always felt like he didn't deserve it. The guests were from different packs, and more were to come.\n\nThey sang songs to the Princess and gifted her precious stones from their land.\n\nDuchess Vivian gave her a bracelet with a supposed wishing gem. They granted one's deepest wishes.\n\nThat was a dangerous gift to give someone like Princess Vanessa.\n\nI stayed up at the hill to ensure I didn't spoil their mood or appetite. I hadn't worn a formal dress, just a long-sleeved jacket with jeans.\n\n\"Rih, what are you doing there?\"\n\nI expected to see my brother Raymond, but I turned to see the Alpha King's son, Prince Chris. My cheeks flushed a little. I jumped from the tree I was on.\n\n\"Um… nothing. Just watching.\" I removed some strands from my face, pushing them backward, looking him in the eyes. I became self-conscious.\n\n\"Hmm. From here? Why don't you go down? Can you see anything?\" he tried to look from where I was standing.\n\nSometimes, he forgot I was the hated Beta's daughter. His niceness to me usually caught me off guard because he was my enemy's brother!\n\nMy ears weren't very sharp, so my eyes were sharper. He was almost slipping from the hill from trying to peek, so I wrapped my hands around him.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he sighed deeply as I pulled him back. My face was beet red, and I dared not look at him. I had felt sparks holding him.\n\n\"Come down and celebrate with us. Your birthday is next soon,\" he stated. I laughed it off. My birthday would go as it came.\n\nI noticed that when I laughed, his eyes seemed to tarry on me, so I frowned. I knew I was ugly when I laughed; he didn't have to stare.\n\n\"You know, laugh more. You look pretty.\"\n\nWhat, sir? Did he mean that? I looked at his retreating figure, and I felt flying insects inside my stomach. Did I swallow butterflies?",

        "content": "Rihanna's POV\n\nThat was the third chariot coming in today, carrying the last Alpha or soon-to-be Alpha or son of an Alpha.\n\nI wanted to laugh—my wolf, Lana, was laughing already.\n\nIt seemed our pretty Princess Vanessa wouldn't find her mate today. If she did, he wouldn't be among those fine Alpha males she hoped for.\n\nLana smirked devilishly, \"Today would be bad for her. I'd annoy her again.\"\n\nI brushed the idea off immediately. \"You wouldn't. Stop acting like a rash cause you have powers. You'd be caught.\"\n\nAnd then I'd be punished for it. I only wish to lie low in this pack and be as happy as I can be.\n\nRaymond ran to me, and I chuckled, seeing him struggle to climb the hill. The gel on his hair had weakened, making his hair look tattered.\n\nBut he looked dashing nevertheless. Nothing seemed to make him look bad.\n\nI looked ahead and saw Princess Vanessa's frustrated face. It remained one more Alpha to arrive.\n\nI didn't get why she, as an Alpha King's daughter, had to get married to an Alpha as well. It should be to her mate, Alpha or not.\n\nAnd if he wasn't Alpha, would she bear to reject him? Insecure thoughts filtered into my head. Would my own mate reject me? I was a no-one.\n\n\"Ahh, Rih, how do you do this!\" Raymond grunted as he finally reached the top of the hill. He laid face up beside me. I rolled my eyes.\n\nHe was just a weak little wolf. Or I was a really strong wolf. I made sure not to show it so as not to get hated more.\n\n\"Why are you here? Won't you go sing for your princess?\" I teased him. I knew he hated her, and his disgusted face confirmed it.\n\n\"Nah, I ran from there because so far, all the Alphas weren't her mate. What if somehow I became her mate? You know, maybe the Moon Goddess gave her a future Beta instead!\"\n\nMy face was contorted. Lana was laughing at me; I didn't even see what was funny. Ray ran from there 'cause he didn't want to be her mate?\n\n\"If you are her mate, you both would feel a mate bond before eighteen. Neither of you felt one, so you can't be her mate now,\" I explained.\n\nAnd if you were, dear brother, I'd make sure you reject her 'cause she'd be the end of you.\n\nRay shrugged. \"She's nice to me recently, so I thought of that. Maybe it's because her brother's coronation is coming,\" Raymond nodded.\n\nThat was another big event coming. By then, all the young girls in our pack would have turned eighteen, so he could be coronated with a Luna Queen. I was a bit anxious.\n\nMy brother would be his future Beta, and I've never been more proud. My father wasn't very respected by the Alpha King.\n\nBut Prince Chris was different. If he could treat me, a nobody, with so much respect, I felt he'd be a better Alpha King than his father was.\n\n\"And here comes Jake Justin of the Black Rose Pack, son of the Alpha. Princess Vanessa better be lucky,\" Raymond looked ahead.\n\nI followed his gaze.\n\nNever had I seen a Black Rose werewolf before. They were usually heavily tanned and very, very sexy. It was a rumor, but it was very true.\n\nJake Justin jumped down from his horse, and I felt the ground tremble from where I was. He had a powerful aura that the pack and guests felt.\n\nHe wore a tuxedo jacket with formal black boots. His hair was in a mullet style, and his dark eyes added more power to him.\n\nAlso, the black rose on his clothes was a chef’s kiss.\n\nPrincess Vanessa shook when he bowed at her. She could barely bow back. I noticed the smirk he had—he knew the aura he emitted.\n\n\"I like that guy already,\" I blurted. I liked any guy who'd mess around with Princess Vanessa and make her feel lower. The Alpha must be well informed.\n\n\"You like him? Well, he and Princess Vanessa don't seem to be mates. Hope for the best!\" Raymond shouted.\n\nMy eyes widened, and I slapped his shoulders. I felt no connection to Jake Justin, so he'd never be my mate. I was near eighteen, and I'd know.\n\n\"I didn't mean I want him as a mate. I just meant I liked that he's messing with Princess Vanessa. Baloney head!\" I added a knock on his head.\n\nHe sprang up from the ground, and I ducked. \"Nah, I'd get you, Rih. For now, let me go grab some cake. Want some?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I don't want her cake.\" My eyes remained fixed on Jake Justin. I watched him interacting with the other Alphas.\n\nThere was something about his smile—it didn't seem real and faded off almost immediately. I recognized those fake smiles.\n\nI gave them a lot during a formal gathering where the Beta's children had to be presented to the council of packs.\n\nRaymond and I should be the Alpha King's Betas, as twins, but my Alpha King rejected me being Beta and threatened to demote me to Omega if I refused to step down.\n\nAll 'cause I destroyed Princess Vanessa's tenth birthday cake and made Raymond take the blame.\n\nI was hated, my position stripped from me.\n\nMy father could do nothing. And my mother seemed like she agreed. My brother and Prince Chris were the only ones who felt pity for me.\n\nThe Alpha of the Red Moon Pack stood up to give a toast to Princess Vanessa. \"To the Princess's health and beauty.\"\n\nEveryone cheered except Jake Justin.\n\nI gagged. Princess Vanessa's beauty was a gift from her mother—and improved greatly by heavy makeup. That Alpha was just looking for a favor.\n\nAnother Alpha stood up to toast, and I realized they'd all toast for her. \"To the Princess's wisdom and grace.\"\n\nLana rolled her eyes. Princess Vanessa had no grace. And wisdom! They were really looking out for the Alpha King's favor.\n\nThe father already had a proud smile. The third Alpha stood up—he seemed like he was searching for what to say.\n\n\"To the Princess's happy marriage and long, long life.\" It was cheered, and even the Alpha King nodded at it. Meh. I awaited Jake Justin's.\n\n\"The Princess is highly blessed already. I'd toast to the future Alpha King and his Betas and to the unity of our Packs under his rulership!\"\n\nLoud cheers erupted from the crowd after Jake Justin's toast. Even my father clapped. The Alpha King's face stiffened, but he forced a smile.\n\nI caught up on what Jake Justin did there. Black Rose Pack was among the packs who had voted for me to be among the Alpha King's Betas. I was so honored that such a powerful pack valued me.\n\n\"Thank you. My Betas and I would do a good job,\" Prince Chris responded to the toast with a bow. And there were more cheers.",

        "content": "Rihanna's POV\n\n“Thank you. My Betas and I will do a good job,” Prince Chris responded to the toast with a bow. And there were more cheers.\n\nJake Justin nodded, and the other Alphas gave him a friendly pat. Raymond wouldn’t, and he also bowed at the Alphas. The same.\n\nIt seemed they searched around for me but couldn’t see me. I noticed Jake Justin looking above the hills, but he looked down again.\n\nI felt more important all of a sudden. The other Alphas didn’t think I was irrelevant to Prince Chris, as well. Lana swelled in pride inside me.\n\n“I like these guys,” she smiled.\n\nI nodded. I really, really like these Alphas.\n\nLana pushed me forward, and we slid down the hill. Jake Justin’s head popped up again, and he looked above the hills.\n\nI forgot Black Rose wolves lived in the forest, so their sense of hearing was very sharp. If he was hearing anything from the hills, he’d be alert.\n\nWalking towards them, an air of intoxicating pride was released by my silver wolf. However, my mind link was broken into, and a hoarse voice ordered, “Rihanna, come NOW!”\n\nMy wolf whimpered—it was our Alpha King.\n\nI saw Raymond look up at where I was, and Jake Justin followed his gaze. They all wanted to see me. But dragging my feet, I went back to my room.\n\nWho was I kidding? Even if other packs thought I was good, my own pack would think otherwise.\n\nI cleared up the place along with Sasha, a maid’s daughter. She swept into my pile of clean plates and smiled. She was a jerk.\n\nI ignored her and rinsed them again. I wasn’t even supposed to be doing this. A Beta’s daughter shouldn’t work with maids.\n\nI was only allowed close after the birthday party. And for what? Cleaning and washing? I was tired of such living but didn’t dare complain.\n\nRaymond always tried to clean my mess up and hurt himself by doing so. He took care of the physical pain. I should handle the mental pain.\n\nI can’t remember the last time I was allowed to train like other wolves, making me very weak. I kept my wolf powers hidden. Raymond did teach me some skills from time to time.\n\nSasha swept towards the dishes she’d saved for another time, and I dropped the one I was washing into the basin.\n\n“Sasha, don’t try it.”\n\nShe had a surprised expression. What, she thought I wouldn’t talk to her? Or she felt I wasn’t strong enough to whoop her ass?!\n\nMaybe I wasn’t—she was trained by Prince Chris. I was jealous over that, but I could bite her and leave an injury that’d take three days to heal.\n\n“Lady Rihanna, I don’t know why you speak, honestly. And what are you gonna do?” she swept more sand into the plate.\n\nMy eyes darkened. She called me ‘Lady’ yet disrespected me. I knew Lana was getting angry. If Lana joined this fight, then it’d be more than biting we’d be doing.\n\n“You don’t want to know, Sasha. You don’t want to know.”\n\nBut she did, as she swept more sand in.\n\n“Tell me, my Lady, what are you going to do?” mockery laced in every word.\n\nI let Lana take charge, and her silvery self grabbed Sasha’s arm, twisting it harshly until she wailed in anguish.\n\nLana stepped back and created a boundary but charged at her again, throwing her off with the invisible boundary. Sasha shifted to her own dark brown wolf.\n\nI dashed to her legs to bite her, but boy was that a wrong move—Sasha flung me from her legs. What kind of power was that?! Lana felt weakened. She wasn’t strong without her powers.\n\nSasha dived down at me on the ground and landed punches that paralyzed me and shifted me back. I headbutted her, but it only made her stagger.\n\nLana groaned in disbelief. How could her blow be this weak? Sasha should be crying! But no, she spat at us, calling us a weak wolf.\n\nSasha tore my face with her claws, and I let out a shrill cry. I wanted to put my hands in my mouth to stop myself, but it came out.\n\nShe had a victorious smirk rising from me, and I just lay there, blood oozing out from my face. Lana wanted to heal me, but I stopped her.\n\nLet them all see this. Wouldn’t they punish her?\n\nIt was my father who came first, and then Raymond. Sasha had wiped off her smirk.\n\nWhat replaced it was a scared and sorry look.\n\n“Beta, I’m sorry, she attacked me suddenly, and my wolf pounced on her.”\n\nI was glad she wasn’t trying to blame it all on me, as it wouldn’t have worked, seeing her face was barely injured while I had a pattern on mine.\n\nRaymond asked what happened, through our twin mind link only we could use. He glanced at the dirt in the water, and he understood me.\n\n“Sasha, you were under punishment for cleaning with Rihanna. Rather, you caused more problems by fighting with her!” Prince Chris barked.\n\nI didn’t know he was there. I felt safe being around my father, Raymond, and Prince Chris. My father hadn’t said anything, just studied my wounds.\n\n“Why don’t they heal?” he asked gently.\n\n“It hurts badly. She clawed my face,” I sniffed, burying my head on him.\n\nSasha forgot her act and cursed at me, making them turn to her.\n\nI smirked. She was a bitch; she could never hide herself.\n\n“So, you started trouble with her, didn’t you?” Raymond barked at her.\n\nShe flinched, looking away. My brother was a damn Beta—she should be scared.\n\nI felt horrible about the way I lived.\n\nI didn’t have any aura as a Beta. I was born one but wasn’t trained as one. I wanted to be free to let my silver wolf get vengeance for me. But she needed to be strong enough to do that.\n\n“Why won’t anyone believe Sasha's story? Rihanna might have attacked her first.”\n\nPrincess Vanessa walked in with her father, the Alpha King.\n\nThey both wore matching caps, having their father-daughter time again.\n\nThe Alpha King’s eyes lingered on my face, and I felt he pitied me, but it became cold again. I was barely holding the pain anymore. Lana bore it all.\n\n“Vanessa, Rihanna is the one injured. And Rihanna is not strong enough to attack Sasha. Stop siding with Sasha!” Prince Chris growled at his sister.\n\nI loved his energy, but I was embarrassed they all thought Sasha was stronger than me—she was, but that’s not how it should be. I’m a Beta.\n\n“Chris, handle this. We have a meeting with the other Alphas before they leave. Come, Raymond, too,” the Alpha King called. He pulled Princess Vanessa with him.\n\nMy brother and father left with them. Raymond gave me a small smile, patting my head.\n\nI don’t know what Prince Chris said to Sasha. It was through a mind link, or my poor hearing couldn’t pick it up, but she cried and ran off.\n\nWe were left alone, and I felt those flying butterflies again! When did I goddamn eat butterflies?!\n\nPrince Chris stooped down to me, still on the ground. I wanted to get up so he didn’t have to stoop, but he stopped me.\n\nHis face was close, and I could see his green eyes peering into my brown ones.\n\n“I've handled Sasha. Now tell your wolf to heal you.”\n\nHe smirked.\n\nHow did he know I stopped my wolf from healing me?\n\nI chuckled nervously and let Lana heal me.\n\n“Those scars—your body is weak—they won’t disappear on time for your birthday. It’s in a week.” He helped me get up.\n\nSparks erupted in me every time. I don’t think he felt them, as he didn’t react.\n\nI arranged my black hair, detangling curls and brushing sand off my body.\n\n“The day will pass like other days. It doesn’t really matter.”\n\n“Didn’t you hear those Alphas? You are on your way to be my Beta. Everything about you matters. I’ll start training you after your birthday.”\n\nHe placed his hands on my shoulders.\n\nI looked down, fighting the flush rising to my face.\n\n“Thank you. I can’t wait for my birthday, then.”\n\nI said it casually, but I really couldn’t wait.\n\nI’d be strong enough to whoop Sasha’s butt, and I could be free to show off Lana, my pretty silver wolf. She purred in excitement.\n\nThose who hated me would have no choice but to fear me. I didn’t need their love anymore.\n\n“Yeah, Raymond will also be legally my Beta, even before the coronation. Oh, and he’ll find his mate, right?” Prince Chris chuckled.\n\nMy eyes widened. I’d be finding my mate, too.\n\nThe flush rose to my face when Prince Chris turned to me.\n\n“You aren’t in pain, are you?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\nDid someone blush when they were in pain?\n\nOr he couldn’t read my expression?\n\nI exhaled and shook my head again.\n\nIt was good he couldn’t.\n\nWhether Prince Chris was my mate—I hope he was—or whoever was my mate, I knew he’d treat me better, and I could be myself around him.\n\nI lowkey wished he was from another pack than mine, as everyone here hated me, and I didn’t want a rejection. I wouldn’t bear a rejection.\n\nBut if it was Prince Chris, then I would be glad.",

        "content": "It was the D-day, the day I'd finally meet him—my mate.\n\nThe day I could show off my silver wolf, bar them all from coming near me, and emit intimidating auras. They’d all shudder in fear as I fulfilled the prophecy.\n\nLong ago, there was a random prophecy that a silver wolf would bless the werewolf land. One stronger than any Alpha King could control.\n\nHe or she wasn’t to be feared, as they weren’t born to cause havoc but to integrate the lands and fight off any werewolves' enemies.\n\nIt was said to be the blessing of the Moon Goddess to her people, but the twisted werewolves assumed it was a curse to control them.\n\nHence ostracizing and killing silver wolves. Many silver wolves were slaughtered and sent away from their packs.\n\nThe Moon Goddess kept on blessing her people with the silver wolf till she stopped—and that was when an Alpha King rose up to stop the belief.\n\nHis mate had been a silver wolf, and he didn’t want her dead. With the help of other Alphas, he silenced the strange curse.\n\nAnd with his mate, conquered all the enemies of the wolves' land. For integrating the lands, he became Alpha King.\n\nThat was the grandfather of our current Alpha King, Wayne. Luckily enough, silver wolves can’t be inherited but given only by the Moon Goddess.\n\nThe werewolves were blessed again with a silver wolf—and that was me.\n\nBut I had shifted while arguing with Raymond and had been scared to shift. When I did, no one cared anymore, and soon I was forgotten.\n\nI snapped back to reality when Raymond danced into my room, flinging his shiny black hair, tied in a ponytail, around. I rolled my eyes.\n\n“You’re gonna be a man today, and you settle for a ponytail?” Even I wouldn’t do that. I brushed it off—it was his problem anyway.\n\nI swirled around in my red ball gown, admiring it. The maids at our mansion had only just realized I existed and helped me into a gown I’d never seen before.\n\nIt was annoying yet touching when my dad showed me his mother’s wedding gown.\n\nMy mom didn’t care how I looked, so didn’t buy anything for me. I had no savings either. I felt bad wearing my granny’s dress, but it was pretty, and I felt content.\n\nAlso, I had to wear pure diamond on my hand and neck. I felt more powerful and confident than I ever had.\n\nAnd when Dad said Grandma only wore those once after her wedding, I shrugged. It was still almost new.\n\n“Let's go!” Raymond yelped and ran out.\n\nI flinched. Had he been watching me the whole while as I was making dramatic poses and facial expressions?\n\nCompared to me, he was wearing a new suede red piece suit that screamed expensive. His hair in a ponytail, but he had a gold hairpin at his sides.\n\nYes, he did like using hairpins. His hair was almost longer than mine.\n\nI tried to make a catwalk out, like our Luna Queen used to do, but I looked like I had pins in my thighs. I loosened up and bounced out, still in grace.\n\nThere was something about my wolf Lana today. I thought she was being calm and nervous about finding our mate, but she just seemed quiet.\n\nI looked around for Raymond as I left for the big yard. Some guards spared me a glance, and I raised my head high.\n\nI saw my twin going towards the ballroom, so I trotted immediately behind him—due to excitement and trying to avoid coming in late.\n\n“We are legal, baby!” I said to Lana. I felt no energy, and it dampened my excitement. Was she feeling something negative happening today?\n\n“My wolf is angry with me?” I sniffed. I heard her chuckle, so I smiled. She always found it funny when I called her a wolf, like she wasn’t!\n\n“And my human is turning eighteen today, not really me. I’ve been with the Moon Goddess for long already,” she sassed back.\n\n“Whatever. Today is your eighteenth year on earth. Loosen up. I think today will be magical.” I swirled around.\n\n“Whatever, too.” She went back to her quiet state and fled to the back of my head. I ignored her since she wasn’t worried about anything exactly.\n\nI was out of the house and to the open field where ballroom celebrations were held. No one was around or looked like they were there.\n\nRaymond was standing outside.\n\n“No one is there?” It was almost a whisper.\n\nHe suddenly smiled and placed a hand on my lips. In our twin mind link, he told me that they were hiding.\n\nMy heartbeat increased, and I felt excited. They planned a surprise birthday for me—and Raymond?\n\nI knew it was done more for Raymond than me, but I couldn’t contain my excitement. I tried to act oblivious and walked into the hall.\n\nRaymond followed me, trying to hide his smirk. “No one here. They forgot. We dressed up for nothing,” he sighed dramatically. I giggled.\n\nBut no one popped up. We stood there for almost minutes. I was beginning to believe they actually forgot. I heard Lana whimper in sadness.\n\nMy hearing wasn’t at its best, so I asked Raymond if he heard something again inside. He answered in the negative. My shoulders slumped.\n\n“So they did forget?” It wasn’t really a question. It was obvious they did. Everyone’s eighteenth birthday was a joy—except ours—because of me.\n\n“Let’s get out of here!” Raymond dragged me through the door. I felt my eyes wet. Couldn’t they have celebrated us—for Raymond at least?\n\nLana was growing angry. What did we actually do to be hated?!\n\nThen I let out a shriek as an exploding sound snapped at my ears. And my blood ran cold.\n\n“Surprise!!!” It was the whole pack, outside the ballroom. Mom and Dad had a ‘Happy Birthday’ card. Our pack members had ‘Happy Birthday Beta’?\n\nWell, since Raymond was officially their only Beta, I guess they’re just celebrating him. Still, I was shocked to my bones to know they came.\n\nThey were all dressed in red and white, which were our official birthday colors.\n\nI raised my legs to find Duchess Vivian, but sadly she wasn’t around. I really was looking forward to a gem bracelet.\n\nWe all went into the ballroom again, and everywhere was lit brightly and showed it was decorated with red, white, and gold.\n\nThe smell of perfumes was almost choking for me, but the sound of music was calming. All eyes went on Raymond and me as they sang our birthday songs.\n\nI felt loved for a while, though it dampened when it was dance time and no one asked me for a dance—not like I could dance.\n\n“You look pretty, Rih. I can’t take my eyes off!” Jude, the pack playboy, grinned at me.\n\nI rolled my eyes but bowed. I moved away before he asked for a dance.\n\nHe always bullied me as a kid. When I grew, he stopped but sometimes threw sarcastic remarks at me. I didn’t know if this was one of them.\n\nI was looking forward to someone seeing me, complimenting me—Prince Chris. But the Alpha King’s family weren’t here yet. Their huge seats were empty.\n\nI was almost tempted to sit at Princess Vanessa's seat. These heels were killing me.\n\nI tried to smile at whoever smiled at me and ignored the fact they only wished Raymond. Dad hugged me and said I looked pretty.\n\nIt seemed I really did. Me brushing my dark curly hair out, straightening it, and adding an eyeliner, popping my blue eyes, was worth it.\n\nAnd then my eyes landed on it. A humongous cake, standing majestically on the center table. It had both our names. I was glad.\n\nI didn’t really like cake after my experience with Princess Vanessa’s. Also, I rarely came to eat for others' birthdays, but this one—I’d enjoy it.\n\n“Where's the Alpha King? And Prince Chris? Please call them. Where are they?” Mom enquired from my dad, with her usual impatient tone.\n\nMy dad was too busy straightening out Raymond’s suit that was rumpled by hugs from the pack members. I came closer to my mom.\n\n“I’d go call them. Where can I find them?” I muttered. It would be wrong for a birthday celebrant to leave her party, but I knew no one minded.\n\nMom gave me a disdained look and shrugged. “I don’t know. Just find them.”\n\nI didn’t let that dampen my spirit and hopped to find them—Prince Chris, exactly. I didn’t need the Alpha King to celebrate me; he didn’t like me anyway.\n\nI heard some yells at the Alpha King’s mansion when coming closer. Peeking, I saw Sasha and Princess Vanessa quarreling about an issue.\n\nThey seemed dressed for my ball party. They weren’t needed. I stared at their dresses—red silk handless dresses. Sasha's had one hand.\n\nShe stomped out and ran into the forest after Princess Vanessa slapped her. Princess Vanessa looked guilty but went back to her house.\n\nA smile came to my lips. I liked when besties fell out. I crawled closer to the house. A sweet smell hit my nose, and I shuddered. What's our Luna Queen cooking now?\n\nI nodded at the guards as I crawled into their courtyard. A naughty guard whistled at me, but I kept on walking. I never minded them—they were just appreciating my beauty!\n\nThe sweet smell became intense and was of vanilla, and it was surely not from the Luna Queen's kitchen. Lana began coming to the surface, attracted by it.\n\nI heard footsteps behind me. “Hey Rih, happy birth—” he stopped. It was Prince Chris. It was good he found me. I didn’t want to knock on the door.\n\nLana began jumping and screaming inside me, attempting to shift. The sweet smell hit me strongly, and I turned to Chris's confused face.\n\nCould he smell it too?\n\n“Mate. Mate!” my wolf yelped.",

        "content": "Rihanna’s POV\n\nPrince Chris was my mate. As I had always dreamed. He was my mate. Lana stopped jumping when she saw his confused look become a bit sad.\n\nDidn’t he want us? How could he be sad to see us? Lana slumped back inside as I walked towards Prince Chris.\n\n“We are mates?” It wasn’t a question. It was clear we were. I may have bad sight, but not a bad sense of smell.\n\nI studied his expression. No, this wasn’t the look of a man who just found their mate. It looked hurt but offended. I looked offended as well.\n\n“You’re not happy we are mates. Why?” I asked him. He didn’t look up into my eyes.\n\nSomeone cleared their throat behind, and I looked to see the Alpha King towering over me. He was dressed as well, only with a black suit.\n\nThe Alpha King looked at us incredulously, and I understood he heard me speaking of mates.\n\nThe Luna Queen walked out, her blonde hair in a high ponytail, making her look taller. She looked over at us.\n\nShe stared at Prince Chris in the eyes and spoke with him through mind link. I wondered what she said, but then she abruptly walked out. Prince Chris sighed.\n\n“You can’t be my son’s mate! What kind of pair is that?” the Alpha King asked the Moon Goddess the last part.\n\n“And why?” I barked. I dared yell at him.\n\nThe Alpha King growled lowly and dragged my hand. “You are a weak wolf! A stupid weak wolf.” Prince Chris pulled his hand from me.\n\nThe Alpha King glared at him, and I looked at Prince Chris, confused. Was he protecting me? Did it mean he was accepting me?\n\n“If not you’re my Beta’s daughter, I’d have thrown you away long ago! You’re a curse to my kingdom,” the Alpha King scowled. Prince Chris's hands fell off me. I felt cold immediately.\n\nThe Alpha King shoved past his son and walked towards the birthday hall. Prince Chris and I stood there in silence. And it was eating me up.\n\n“I am not weak, Prince Chris. Train me and I’d be really strong. My wolf is a—” he placed his hands on my mouth.\n\nWait, he should hear me out. I had a silver wolf. I was useful to the pack. I wasn’t weak. Lana became jittery and paced around me.\n\n“He is going to reject us. We’d be rejected by our mate. I knew it. That’s what saddened my heart earlier today. I knew it.”\n\nI still kept quiet. Prince Chris and I always connected. He couldn’t…\n\n“I’d reject you, Rih.” He broke my heart. “Maybe you’d find someone else that’d love you, but I have to reject you. I’m an Alpha King.”\n\nMy breathing became uneven. The Alpha King’s words echoed in my head. I was weak. I was stupid. Even my mate doesn’t want me.\n\nAnd why! No one wants to tell me why I am hated. For destroying Vanessa’s cake as a nine-year-old? Then I’m sorry. Why would I be labelled with such hate!\n\n“But you like me.” A lump was in my throat. I telepathically shared my pain with my twin so I'd be able to speak clearly. “And I like you too.”\n\nHis eyes sank. He looked away from me. “Well, that’s how mate pull works, isn’t it?” He let out a painful chuckle. “It makes you think you’re in love.”\n\nHis words. I couldn’t believe them. Did he just deem the mate pull insignificant? Lana roared in me, and I was scared of her reaction.\n\n“Let him reject us already. He’s right—we were only interested in him due to the mate pull. He isn’t worth us.” Her voice died to a whimper.\n\nShe didn’t believe what she was saying. I didn’t know what to believe now.\n\nPrince Chris exhaled just as Raymond found us in front of the Alpha King’s mansion. With him came my parents, the guests, and the pack members. Will I be rejected in front of them? On a day that was supposed to be special to me?\n\n“Chris! Reject her already!” I heard the Luna Queen’s voice.\n\nThe people gasped and began whispering. Raymond came closer, but the Luna Queen growled at him to stop. Prince Chris exhaled again.\n\nLana frowned. “Why’s he wasting time?”\n\nI yelled back at her, “Do you really want to be rejected?”\n\n“I don’t want to be ridiculed, Rihanna. I am a silver wolf. A goddamn silver wolf. Don’t you see they don’t know? If they know, they’d make you stay—but enslave you. Do you want that?”\n\nRealization hit me. My pack had forgotten I was a silver wolf, or else they wouldn’t reject me. I wiped off my streaming tears.\n\n“I was only nice to you because I pitied you, Rih. I, Prince Chris Wayne, reject you, Rihanna Sam, as my mate. I’m sorry. May the Moon Goddess help you.”\n\nThe whispers increased, and I saw Princess Vanessa’s head from a window. She had a smirk on. Some pack members had smirks on too.\n\nThey all celebrated my pain. Lana sighed. I don’t know where she got strength from, but I felt strength coming in me too. Some guests looked sorry, and my father bowed his head.\n\n“Fine!” I blurted.\n\nPrince Chris had been avoiding my gaze, but when I spoke, his head snapped to my direction. “What?”\n\nI looked at Raymond, whose eyes were already red. “I said fine.” I repeated, looking back at Prince Chris.\n\n“And I, Rihanna Sam, accept your rejection, Future Alpha King Chris Wayne.” I had a pronounced mocking tone on “Alpha King.”\n\nThe Luna Queen growled and came forward. “That’s bold of you. So there’s some strength in you after all.”\n\nI shook my head. Strength she never knew I had. I looked back at Raymond and my parents. My mom—she had an indifferent expression.\n\n“I’m leaving,” I said to Raymond through our mind link and turned around, walking out on all of them.\n\nMy red dress restrained me, so I tore it out, dropping the piece on the ground. I felt hurt ripping my grandmother’s wedding dress.\n\nBut while it held memories for her, it held sorrows for me. I hate my pack. Damn them! Damn all of them! I had my wolf to protect me.\n\nRaymond followed behind me. When I heard my dad coming, I snapped back and growled at him. “Don't follow me, Beta.” I had the same mock emphasis. It shocked him. He was the weak wolf.\n\nHis daughter had to face humiliation, face rejection when she was a Beta’s daughter. He didn’t deserve to be my dad. Some better man must have produced me.\n\nWhen I got to the house, Raymond helped me do whatever I wanted. Remove my makeup. Trash the house in anger.\n\nDestroy all my paintings of Prince Chris, Mom, and Dad—and finally pack my things.\n\nHe was hesitant. “You are leaving?” It wasn’t much of a question. He knew I would. “You’d be killed. Prince Chris would have to hunt you.”\n\nLana seethed and collapsed in me, her last wall of courage failing. He was no longer our mate. Why did he still affect her?\n\nI sniffed. “Well, then I’d do what rogues do. Fight. But I wouldn’t be like other rogues with no purpose. I’d have a pack. A pack for real.”\n\nI stared at Raymond's brown eyes as they reflected mine. I was determined, and he needed to see that. His twin would be okay.\n\nI folded the last painting—one of Raymond—and threw it into my bag. Strapping it behind me, I bounced out of the house.\n\n“Where would I find you? Won’t you like to see my own mate?” Raymond blocked me, his tears free falling. He was the last thing I had here but shouldn’t stop me from leaving.\n\n“She’d be a good girl. If not, reject her—'cause even gems can be rejected.” I shoved him aside and continued on my way.\n\nMy tears fell from my eyes. I didn’t want to turn back or I could stay.\n\n“Change your name.” I heard him say. I peeked back. “Change your name. I’d fake your death so no one would come after you.”\n\nI was surprised at his words. Fake death? Would they believe it after I'd been headstrong? How’d I have my revenge if they think I’m dead?\n\n“Even better. They won’t know what hit them,” Lana replied slyly. Her voice stronger.\n\nI nodded to Raymond without facing him. “I will. Thank you. Bye. Protect our weak parents.” I saluted and continued on my way.\n\n“We are free.”\n\n“We are free,” I repeated after Lana.\n\n“We are rogues,” she added. I paused.\n\n“And that’s not as bad as it sounds.”\n\nI felt a surge of energy blow through me as I crouched on my knees. Strapping my bag on my shoulders, I tried to shift.\n\nI hadn’t shifted for almost five years. It was stressful and long and very painful, but soon silvery fur covered my arms and legs.\n\nA boundary formed in front of me—one I knew only I could see.\n\nI suppressed the howl trying to escape my lips. That would attract attention. I couldn’t adore my silver wolf as I couldn’t see myself.\n\nBut I felt powerful with my sharp claws and silvery fur. I was enchanting, I knew it. Lana stretched her paws and made small jumps.\n\n“You ready, Silver?”\n\n“I’m your Silver. Tell me when you’re ready,” my wolf responded energetically. “Your Silver.” I repeated it to myself. I liked it.\n\n“Yes, we are ‘Your Silver.’ The only thing strong enough to cause a wolf pain—even Alpha Kings.” Lana bounced impatiently, and I told her to run.\n\nShe sped like a bolt past the trees that I felt I saw them move. She maintained the speed, breaking stones and twigs under her feet.\n\nWe looked back at the hills we always visited. It was far behind us, as was our pack.\n\nToday I was a rogue.\n\nAnd not just any rogue.\n\nA Silver Wolf rogue.\n\nThe people who hurt me had seen nothing yet.\n\nNothing.\n\nThey rejected a silver wolf—\n\nbut she’d be back.",

That wolf owes my pack.”\n\n“A Lycan is better killed than ‘petted’, if that was what you wanted. And it is an old Lycan, not worth a silver wolf?” I argued, with finality.\n\n“But my King…”\n\n“There’s nothing like an old Lycan, my King!” someone said, while walking into the courtroom.\n\nThe guards bowed at him, so I knew it was my Beta, Raymond.

        "content": "“Would you like to do it, Your Highness, or should I?” She looked at the Lycan King indifferently, whose lilac eyes of affection were suddenly intruded by confusion.\n\n“Wh-what do you mean?” He asked as he tried to concentrate on the beautiful voice of the woman in front of him, his mate. He was here for a meet-and-greet session that he dreaded.\n\nThe worst thing was that this session among Alphas, Lunas and their Gammas from every pack in existence was to last for the entire night!\n\n‘Why couldn’t they just skip this night and officially start the one-month collaboration tomorrow?’ the King thought to himself every year.\n\nShe raised her eyebrows as she studied his expression, “Huh. You do look genuinely confused.”\n\nHis eyebrows furrowed, confused and irritated now, “Again, what do you mean? And what is your name?”\n\nThe Alphas, Lunas and the best warriors of each pack, called Gammas, just arrived and he, as their benevolent king, was here to greet them.\n\nAlthough, if he were given a choice, this king would have rather been going through the reports of rogue attacks that were steadily piling up on his desk. He couldn’t wait to get the night over with. If he made his rounds quickly enough, he would still reach home on time to get through three or four files before bed.\n\nBut when he walked through the doors of the gathering hall, his impatience, reluctance and pure hate for the meet-and-greet vaporized in an instant.\n\n“My name is Lucianne Freesia Paw, Your Highness. I take it that you’re going to do it, then?” She said simply.\n\nTo the King, her name felt like the first spring breeze after many long months of harsh winter, the soft light penetrating through the grey clouds, the breath of life in a cold, dark world.\n\n“Do what?” His confusion couldn’t be masked even if he tried. He felt like his mate was already ten feet away when he had only taken the first step.\n\nWhen he entered the hall, every wolf and Lycan present looked in his direction and they either nodded or bowed but he merely glanced over them.\n\nThe animal in him was following a scent that has never graced his nostrils. Butterfly pea and jasmine.\n\n‘What a unique combination’, he thought to himself.\n\nHis footsteps gained speed as the scent got stronger. Then, he stopped right behind a five-foot-one brunette.\n\nHer back was small, half of it covered with dark, luscious curls falling effortlessly from her head. There was only one word in his mind—mate.\n\nThe figure started turning around to face him, and his heart stopped. She was surprised by his sudden presence and took a step back.\n\nThe animal in his head growled, ‘Mine’.\n\nLucianne turned around because she noticed the stunned faces of her Alpha and Luna, who both bowed in her direction.\n\nUpon turning, she came face-to-face with a white suit covered with a black tuxedo, and a strong scent of acacia wood and forest trees graced her nostrils. Shocked at the proximity, she took a step back to see who it was.\n\nRealizing that the dark-haired man with slightly tanned skin and lilac eyes was the King himself, she understood her pack leaders’ action. She, too, bent her knees and lowered her head as a form of respect to the highest ruler of all werewolves and Lycans.\n\nA warm feeling crept up her shoulders before she felt the sparks where his hands made contact with her skin. To her dread, she realized that the man in front of her was her mate who spoke in his clear, deep voice, “You don’t have to do that. Please stand. Don’t bow to me.” He said with visible pain and disapproval in his eyes.\n\nAlthough surprised by the King’s response, Lucianne couldn’t escape her reality of how the bond was going to end. ‘Here we go again’, she thought, before proceeding to ask whether he wanted her to do it, or that he wanted to do it himself—to reject her.\n\n“Do what, Lucianne? Talk to me.” His voice was soft but demanding. His eyes were desperate and lost.\n\nShe explained calmly, “Reject me, Your Highness. Do you prefer it if I did it or would you like to do it yourself?” The hope and life she gave him earlier seemed like it was about to be snatched away from him almost as soon as he found them.\n\nThe King’s lilac eyes turned onyx as he growled thunderously, scaring everyone who was there. The room fell into dead silence. After he exploded in anger at what he had just heard, the King asked in a low, frightening tone,\n\n“Why the f*ck would either one of us reject the other?”\n\nLucianne was surprised again but she remained calm. She shrugged and said, “I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I’m not your type, not good enough for you, not pretty enough, you may already have a chosen mate to be engaged to…”\n\nBefore she could finish, her Luna hissed, “Stop it, Lucy!”\n\nThe King’s eyes met the Luna’s and he growled, “I didn’t ask you to speak.”",

        "content": "The Luna and her Alpha mate bowed their heads in unison as a sign of apology. No right-minded wolf would challenge a Lycan, let alone the King of Lycans.\n\nThe King faced his mate again, his eyes softened a little by how dainty and beautiful she looked. Why did she want to take herself away from him?\n\nHe asked in a murderous tone, “Who told you those things?”\n\nLucianne’s eyes turned wide abruptly, “Oh no, Your Highness. That’s not what I meant. It’s just… that’s what my previous mates told me before or after they rejected me so I was just giving you an idea on what I’m talking about.”\n\n“Previous MATES?” Just hearing the word he felt uncontrollable jealousy and anger. He was the one who should be her MATE and not any other person.\n\nHis angered eyes bore into her unperturbed ones as he asked in a dangerously low tone, “Forget that for now. Do you want to reject me?”\n\nShe took a moment to think. No one had ever asked her this question.\n\n“That’s a very difficult question to answer, Your Highness. I don’t even know you. I admit that there is the mate bond for now, and I do acknowledge that I feel the sparks but whether I want the rejection… hm, I honestly don’t know. But then again, what I wanted never really mattered. My previous mates pretty much decided it for me. That, or they made my decision easy. I do prefer an earlier rejection when there are no memories made as of yet because it would hurt much less. Does that make sense, Your Highness?”\n\nXandar responded firmly, “No. And stop calling me ‘Your Highness’. You are my mate and I am yours. The mate bond is there for now and forever. The sparks will get stronger. And neither of us are rejecting the other.”\n\nThere was fury in his voice but also desperation. Desperation to not lose his mate when he had just found her. Desperation for her to accept him and stay with him forever.\n\nShe nodded grudgingly once and bit her bottom lip as she dove into her own thoughts.\n\nHe sighed. His eyes were gaining back their lilac shades as his fingers reached for her chin and lifted it up gently for their eyes to lock.\n\n“What are you thinking about, Lucianne?” His voice no longer held anger, only gentleness and guilt.\n\nShe opened her mouth to say something but closed it after a second thought. She smiled meekly and shook her head slightly before she said, “I was just thinking about the ceremony tomorrow. That’s all.”\n\n“Lucianne,” he reached for her cheek this time as he said, “I’m sorry I yelled at you. But don’t lie to me, please. Tell me. What were you thinking about?”\n\nHer eyes dimmed as she looked at the ground, and Xandar felt his heart clenching by her saddened look. She composed herself and muttered, “I can’t understand why you won’t reject me.”\n\n“Because you’re my mate!” He whisper-yelled, not that it helped. In a room filled with Lycans and werewolves known for their sharp hearing, it was without a doubt that everyone heard their king.\n\n“Okay.” She said meekly and forced a smile.\n\nNo one had to tell him that she was unconvinced by how he felt about her. But why would she doubt him? The mate bond was supposed to automatically signify love and commitment. Why didn’t she believe him?\n\nHis hand suddenly had a mind of its own as it began tracing her right arm in hopes of soothing her and chasing away her doubts.\n\nWhen he felt the unevenness of her skin, he wasted no time taking a step to her side to examine the cause.\n\nThere was a 5-inch scar. Injuries and wounds could heal but for some brutal attacks and accidents, a scar would remain.\n\nThe King’s eyes darkened again, and he growled so loudly that the werewolves around them took a step back as they held their heads low.\n\n“What? What is it?” Lucianne frantically asked, equally alarmed.\n\nShe felt the scar on her arm with her left hand but she wasn’t sure what the fuss was about so she looked at the King in confusion, whose onyx eyes were still glued there.\n\nHe pushed her left hand away gently and started tracing the scar with his fingers. Lucianne fought through the pleasurable sparks erupting from that area. With his eyes still fixed there, he asked in a low, homicidal tone, “Who did this?”\n\nLucianne shrugged, “It was just the rogues. Five, maybe six years ago. It’s just a dried-up part of the skin, isn’t it?”\n\nHis dark eyes never left the part of her flesh that was once torn so badly that its appearance never healed. He then locked eyes with Lucianne as he asked in dismay, “How are you okay with this?”\n\n“Your Highness, I’m…”\n\n“Xandar.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Don’t call me by my title or my full name. It’s just Xandar to you, Lucianne.”",

        "content": "She hesitated before she began, “Xandar, a scar is normal among warriors, more so among Gammas. If you check the bodies of the other Gammas here today, you’ll find that many of them have scars as well. Some may be worse than mine. I know a few Alphas and a handful of Lunas who have such scars from fighting alongside their pack. This really isn’t a big deal.”\n\nHe listened to her words, and his eyes softened at how she shoved her own ordeal aside to put other warriors and pack leaders under the spotlight of bravery.\n\nNo one knew that, at that time, whatever Lucianne said only made their king more certain that there was no one more qualified to lead alongside him as his queen.\n\nHis heart ached when his gaze returned to the scar on his beautiful mate. When he bent down and was close to kissing the scar,\n\nLucianne abruptly retracted her arm as she uttered, “Perhaps that is not the most appropriate thing to do, given this setting.”\n\nHe had completely forgotten about the people around them. He only saw her. With those words, he was pulled back into reality. He smiled, making the Lycans in the room stunned.\n\nThe King never smiled. Never.\n\nXandar was happy that Lucianne was not submissive just because he is king. He then said, “You’re right. I would like to meet your pack leaders, Lucianne. Introduce us?”\n\n“Of course.” She smiled, and waved her Alpha and Luna over.\n\nThey walked towards the King and bowed, their heads still facing the ground as Lucianne said, “These are Alpha Juan and Luna Hale of the Blue Crescent Pack, your High—Xandar.”\n\nShe abruptly decided against addressing Xandar by his title when she saw, from the corner of her eye, that he was about to make a fuss.\n\n“Heads up, leaders of the Blue Crescent Pack.” Xandar said with a smile. When their heads were raised, Xandar thrusted out his hand in Alpha Juan’s direction, “I want to personally thank you for leading the rogue attack up North last year. The rogues would’ve continued to wreak havoc if it weren’t for your pack’s leadership and contribution.”\n\nThe King remembered reading a report on the successful annihilation of one of the strongest rogue packs in the previous year, and had long known the Blue Crescent Pack was at the forefront of the victory. It was said that this pack held the trust of the other packs, and was respected for the leadership displayed.\n\nThere were many testimonials from other pack warriors who thanked the Blue Crescent Pack, saying that they ‘had learnt a lot’ in terms of strategy and combat.\n\nAlpha Juan and Luna Hale were both stunned by the King’s graciousness. It was no secret that one should just be grateful to not get killed. It was not customary for the King to hand out praises.\n\nJuan took the King’s hand and shook it once before he admitted sheepishly, “As your subjects, we are more than grateful to assist in your endeavors, Your Highness. But my Luna and I cannot take credit for the success last year. We may be the largest in size in our pack, but our Gamma, Lucy,” Juan motioned in Lucianne’s direction, before continuing, “was the strategist, the best trainer and warrior, be it on the battlefield last year or within our own pack. I’m her subordinate when it comes to training. She was the one who led us to victory.”\n\nLucianne was biting her bottom lip. When she knew what Juan was going to say, she tried to stop him through their mind-link but he didn’t bother listening to her. Her eyes were fixed on the ground as she prayed for the moment to be over.\n\nShe couldn’t see it but Xandar’s eyes beamed with admiration for her. When he noticed that her eyes were pinned to the ground, he frowned and asked in concern, “Lucianne, what’s wrong?”\n\nLucianne shook her head and responded meekly, “Nothing. Just tired.”\n\nHe nodded in understanding. Most wolves had to travel a long way to Lycan territory so it was a given that they would be drained when they arrived.\n\nHe turned to face everyone as he announced, “My fellow subjects, I thank you for making the trip here. Let this night be the beginning of a worthwhile collaboration between packs and species. Please have some food if you haven’t already. I would like to meet every one of you. Give me a few minutes. I will be right back to thank every pack who has assisted me these past few years. Enjoy the evening.”\n\nThe speech left everyone surprised. The King was never this welcoming. It was no secret that he hated this night every year. But now he was not only welcoming them with open arms, he promised to thank the helpful packs personally!\n\nDisregarding the stares, he turned to Lucianne and said, “Lucianne, you should get some rest. Let me walk you back.”\n\nShe looked at her pack leaders in panic but Juan said, “We’ll be fine, Lucy. Go. You hardly slept last night.”\n\nXandar’s heart clenched again with Juan’s words but he chose to say nothing. When his hand fell on Lucianne’s small waist, she gasped and stiffened but made no move to push it away. So, he left his hand there as he led her out of the hall.\n\nAs soon as they were out of the building, Xandar asked, “Why didn’t you sleep last night?”",

        "content": "“Border duty.” She answered simply.\n\n“How is it that you had border duty the night before you were bound to travel?”\n\n“The available members were either sick or had a family to look after. I didn’t want to flip anyone’s schedules upside down over this so I stood in place.” She shrugged. Her selfless answer exuded the nobility of a queen, his queen.\n\nBut something still bothered him. “Lucianne, why were you uncomfortable when your Alpha gave you credit for last year’s success? Why didn’t you just thank him and accept the praise?”\n\nShe snorted, and she looked him dead in the eye, “I didn’t do it for the praise, Your Hig… Xandar. When Alpha Juan got the request, I made it a point to my warriors that the ultimate aim of the war was to keep innocent wolves safe. I drilled this thought into their heads day-in and day-out. They were to fight to protect, to fight with honor and nobility, not for the sake of pleasing anyone of a superior position.”\n\nHe listened to the strength of her voice, and his lips curled up as she continued, “I didn’t accept the praise because I didn’t do it for that. I didn’t do it for you either, Xandar. I respect you as my king but I didn’t fight the rogues for you. I fought for those who couldn’t fight. That’s why I didn’t accept the praise. I never will, so don’t try to get me to do it.”\n\nHis animal howled internally with immense joy and pride. He and the Lycan in him could not thank their Goddess enough. They were completely over the moon that the Moon Goddess bonded them to… a goddess. Noble. Selfless. Brave. Beautiful. What pique his interest most was her confident admission that she prioritized the lives of innocent wolves that she had never met over her ruler who everyone was obliged to please.\n\nBut somehow, she still seemed unreachable. He felt that she didn’t allow herself to get as close to him as he wanted her to. Then, there was that confusion about her willingness to reject him, or have him reject her. What was that about? Why would she ask for something like that?\n\nHe then recalled that she mentioned her ‘previous mates’. Mates. So, she was rejected more than once before. But why would she think that he was like the rest of them? He was not a wolf. Surely, Lycans were more known for their unwillingness to deny the mate bond, weren’t they?\n\nHe admired her side profile in silence, taking in the most beautiful creature he had ever laid his eyes on. He hoped to learn everything about her one day, but for better or worse, he was dead certain that he would never let his mate go.\n\nWhen they reached the hotel where they housed a portion of wolves, Lucianne was surprised that Xandar still insisted on following her until they reached her room. He stared at her scar with a frown as she unlocked the door. “Thank you for walking me back. Have a good night, Xandar.” Her sweet voice brought his gaze up to hers.\n\nShe took only one step into her room when Xandar grabbed her by her wrist and lifted her hand to his lips. She stiffened in shock as he planted a deep kiss on the back of her hand, sending a strong wave of sparks through her arm and then her entire body.\n\nHe was still holding her hand when he locked eyes with her and uttered, “Goodnight, Lucianne.”\n\nShe retracted her hand, and entered her room before shutting the door behind her. Xandar stood in his spot, where he heard her sigh after she closed the door. He then heard cupboard doors opening and closing before her footsteps moved across the room, where he heard a second door being shut.\n\nAfter some shuffling sounds, he heard the water from the shower, and the Lycan part of him was aroused by the thought of his mate naked in the bathroom. He walked away from her door in quickly before his self-control evaporated.\n\nHe could easily break the hinges and knock down the door if he wanted to. Ignoring his whimpering animal who would rather skip the meet-and-greet and spend the night with their mate, he returned to the hall and started making his rounds.\n\nHe found it amusing when pack leaders and warriors displayed their surprise after he expressed his gratitude to them. There were several self-entitled Alphas and snobbish Lunas who tried and failed lamentably to be noble as they humble-bragged.\n\nXandar started taking an interest in scars which were visible on his subjects’ bodies despite their clothes. The warrior from the Blood Eclipse Pack, Gamma Raden, had a scar on his face tracing down to his neck. If the scar went a little higher, he would’ve been rendered blind on one side.\n\n“How did it happen?” He asked in concern as he gestured to the scar.\n\nThe warrior smiled graciously as he explained, “A rogue attack five years ago, Your Highness. Our pack was attacked and we formed alliances with Blue Crescent and White Blood to eradicate the rogues.”\n\n“Were many injured?” the King asked.\n\n“We lost two wolves in the final attack, sadly, but the death toll was higher before our alliance. Although it’s displeasing to the eye, I must admit that this scar only brings me joy.” He said with sincerity.\n\nThe King’s curiosity was pique, “What do you mean by that, Gamma Raden?”",

        "content": "He glanced over at his pack leaders before he explained, “When the rogues attacked, some of us who had the strength took on more than one rogue at a time. When I kept taking on two at a time, the rogues took notice. All of a sudden, I found myself surrounded by five of them. One held me by my tail and its member slashed me from the side and gave me this scar.”\n\nHe gestured to his face before continuing, “When the blood from my face was oozing, the Gammas from our ally packs pounced in and tore the rogues apart, leaving the rogue who slashed me for me to chase before I tore its throat.”\n\nRaden smiled, “The scar brings me joy because it has been a long time since I knew I could count on someone from another pack to watch my back. I’m not an Alpha, and I’m not a member of their pack. They had no obligation to save me but they did.”\n\nThe King listened attentively, “Blue Crescent and White Blood, you say?”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness.” Raden said with a slight bow and added, “The warrior from White Blood is Gamma Tobias Tristan. And you’ve already met the warrior from Blue Crescent, Gamma Lucianne Paw.”\n\n“Mm…” the King nodded.\n\nGamma Raden then glanced at his leaders again, who both have doubtful gazes. He cleared his throat, and with visible fear in his eyes, he began, “Your Highness?”\n\n“Yes, Gamma Raden?” The King obliged with a smile.\n\nThe Gamma said cautiously, “I wasn’t standing very near where you were when you met Gamma Lucianne so I’m not sure if what I heard was…what I heard.” He hesitated, “You mentioned that Lucy is your mate?”\n\n“I did, and she is.” The King responded with a smile, despite the tint of jealousy from the way this warrior called his mate ‘Lucy’ with such affection.\n\nGamma Raden nodded and said, “I’m not sure if you’re going to kill me for what I’m about to say, Your Highness. But as I said, I owe her my life, so I think this is going to be a fair trade.”\n\nHe chuckled once, before saying seriously, “Your Highness, I beg you, don’t hurt her. She is a good person who, for some unknown reason, was forced to go through with more than most.”\n\nThe King’s eyebrows were furrowed. He felt insulted. Why would this Gamma think that he, as Lucianne’s mate, couldn’t take care of her? Who the hell did this wolf think he was?!\n\nThe King tried his best to keep his composure and declared in a serious tone, “I would never even think of hurting her. She’s my mate. I would start a war before I let her get hurt. Including members of Blood Eclipse. Do enjoy the rest of the evening.”\n\nHe walked away in quick steps as he felt the jealousy overtaking his body when Raden expressed so much concern for Lucianne. If he stayed any longer, he might have killed Raden.\n\nXandar saw Luna Lyssa bowing to him, who was running her pack after the death of her husband the previous month. He suddenly remembered that they had a personal meeting scheduled, but he had forgotten.\n\nToday his mind and heart are occupied with Lucianne.\n\nAs he was about to speak, Xandar felt a hand run down his arm seductively, making him turn his sights to glare at the owner.\n\nHe asked in a dangerously low tone, “What the hell are you doing?”\n\nIt was the daughter of his Defense Minister, Sasha Cummings, who smiled coyly at the King, making Xandar angrier.\n\n“Sasha,” her father approached them.\n\nThe King growled again, “Discipline your daughter, or we’ll have to discuss your future and hers, Cummings.”\n\nSasha was left stunned but opted to say nothing, and she held her head low as her father bowed and apologized, “I’m terribly sorry, Your Highness. I should’ve been more alert. We’ll excuse ourselves now.”\n\nThe King’s glare remained on them until they were far enough for his comfort. He thought about Lucianne to calm himself before talk to the Luna, “I apologize for late, Luna Lyssa. We were plan to talking about the construction works for a training ground in your pack, if I’m not mistaken?”\n\nLuna Lyssa didn’t expect an apology from the King, and was quite surprised by his sincerity. She was more encouraged to show her enthusiasm when she spoke about her plans to mandate every able pack member to fight. The King supported her, and encouraged her to submit a financial application should she need help.\n\nAfter he left Luna Lyssa, Alpha Juan and Luna Hale approached him hastily and nervously. They stood before him and bowed before Xandar said, “Heads up, pack leaders of Blue Crescent. To what do I owe this pleasure?”\n\nTheir raised heads were met with the King’s smiling eyes. No king in history was known to find meeting werewolves a ‘pleasure’, and no Lycan would bother offering a smile to their species, let alone the King himself.\n\nAlpha Juan glanced at his mate, who nodded encouragingly. The Alpha looked at the King and spoke doubtfully, “My Gamma is your mate, Your Highness?”\n\nNow, he was getting pissed off. His eyebrows furrowed as he asked, “She is. Is there a problem?”",

I don’t want to see her hurt by the mate bond again. I’ve known her since we were kids. She’s like a sister to me. It pains me and my Luna to see her hurt.”\n\nIf Alpha Juan didn’t have a mate, Xandar was dead certain that he would have torn the Alpha’s throat right then and there out of pure jealousy. Gamma Raden had already emptied his patience reservoir, and Xandar was clinging on to the thread of patience he had left for the night.\n\n“Why would you think that I’m not serious about Lucianne, Alpha Juan?” He asked, taking some comfort in saying her name.\n\nAlpha Juan said, “My king, I admit that I don’t know your intention with Lucy.

We must stop hoping that help will come on time when we need it because last year clearly showed that it may not.”\n\n“It’s time to stop wishful thinking. It’s time to step up. It’s time that every able pack member learned to fight. I’ve spoken to my Alpha, and he has agreed to offer training sessions to Gammas and warriors from any pack who are interested. It is better to have sufficient defenders in your own pack to buy your allies time to come help you.”\n\n“With that being said, the Blue Crescent Pack is not the only one blessed with trained warriors. Many of you in this room have the necessary skills. You know who you are. Please, offer your grounds and your time. The rogues are getting stronger. The rumors about rogue Lycans have not died down.”\n\n“This is no time for pack rivalry. We are all the children of the Moon Goddess. In effect",

It hurts!”\n\nHer father pulled her hair which made her cry more. A devil-in-disguise as her biological father punched her in the stomach. She could only gasp with pain as she fell to the cold, tiled floor.\n\nWhimpering due to the excruciating feeling in her stomach after being punched by her own father, Michelle had no strength to fight anymore. As tears kept shedding down her face, she recalled how her life became miserable after her father turned into a gambler; multiple debts were passed on to her to pay, the threatening words from the loan sharks whom he borrowed from and paying the high interest that completely ruined the plan she had in life.\n\nShe was only twenty-two, yet had a handful shits on her plate because of her addicted father. She was tired of it!\n\n“I’m telling you this, Michelle!” Her father’s voice thundered inside the little apartment where she bunked with her best friend, Megan. “I need the money by tomorrow! It’s just a simple request to save your father’s life! Don’t be so selfish!”\n\nSelfish. That was how her father saw her whenever she couldn’t give the money he demanded. He thought she was selfish, not even knowing that getting it wasn’t something that could be easily done. In fact, she had to sell herself just to pay his over-the-neck debts!\n\nMichelle sat upright when her father finally left the apartment. Her arms had bruises after the beatings she got from her own father; the pain was evident yet the reality that her father didn’t see her worth was way upsetting more than the physical abuse. She was just a daughter who wanted to be loved; who wanted to be treated fairly by her father; to be taken care of just like the normal daughters out there. However, that wasn’t the case given to her.\n\n***\n\n“My goodness, Mich! What happened to your face?!” Megan rushed towards her as soon as her best friend saw the bruises on her face.\n\nMichelle was sitting in front of the little vanity mirror, trying to cover her bruises by applying makeup tricks. She needed to go to work... for the last time, as she decided to end her misery. Her savings should be enough to pay off her father’s handful of debt. After that, she would live a new life. She wanted to be selfish for once and her father had no right to say a thing about it.\n\nMegan looked at her worriedly. “Did your father come here again? Did he do that to you? I think we should report him to the cops!”\n\n“There’s no need, Meg. I’m fine,” she said, offering her a thin smile.\n\n“No, you’re not! You’re abused, for the love of God, Mich! Look at yourself!”\n\nMichelle let out a sigh of defeat and spun on Megan. “I swear this will be the last time that you’ll see me with all these bruises. This time, I’ll do what I want without thinking about him.” She smiled but it didn’t reach her eyes. “I have enough of his shit.”\n\nMegan’s expression softened and embraced her. “God, I’m so disappointed in your dad. He’s lucky to have you. He should see your worth.”\n\n“I’m disappointed in him too.” She sighed, blinking her tears away.\n\n***\n\nMichelle took a few deep breaths as soon as she arrived at the familiar stripper’s club. She worked as a stripper in that place, not only to support her education but also to pay off her father’s debt. Sure, the work wasn’t the typical job of someone who had taken a professional business course in college, but she had no choice three years ago. This was the only job that could give her the money she badly needed.\n\n“Let’s give one last look at this filthy place,” she uttered, surveying the outside appearance of the club before going inside.\n\nShe went straight into the dressing room after handing over her resignation to her boss, sat on the vanity table, and started retouching her makeup, making sure that her bruises weren’t visible as she could not afford to disappoint. After minutes, she was done and satisfied with her overall look.\n\nMichelle appeared to be a walking temptation, dressed in sultry lingerie that complimented her hourglass-shaped body. Following a couple of performances by her colleagues, Michelle went backstage for her turn as the night's highlight.\n\n\"Gentlemen, let’s give a round of applause to the sexiest and hottest stripper in the club. Here comes the queen, Mika!\" announced the host.\n\n\"This will be the last time, Mich...” she whispered, walking onto the stage where she was greeted by the loud cheers coming from the crowd.\n\nSeconds later, she heard the enticing French music she chose for her last performance. The strobe lights went red and blue, and the spotlight hit her torso. She strolled sexily onstage and swung her hips, dancing with her hands all over her body, making men drool. She closed her eyes, swayed her hips, and then caressed her crotch. When she opened them, she saw a man's marble gray eyes among the crowd. Michelle had to admit that the man was handsome and enigmatic. A tingling excitement coursed through her by the way he looked at her thighs and crotch.\n\nMichelle captured the attention of every male in the crowd, including the man who first caught her attention. By his looks, she could see he was turned on. Minutes afterward, her performance ended. All the men cheered, applauding their hands. She gave a flying kiss and thanked everyone, then glanced in the man’s direction, meeting his intense gaze before she walked backstage.\n\n\"Bravo! Our star has done it again!\" Chester, the owner of the club, congratulated her. \"I want to give you something as a gift, Mika. Come to my office.\"\n\n\"Sure!\" Michelle then followed Chester to his office.\n\n\"Have a seat,\" Chester told her when they entered his office. Michelle sat on the couch and then noticed him staring at the brown envelope on his desk. \"Actually, someone wants to—\"\n\n\"Don’t forget that I’m a performer, Ches. Not a sex worker,\" she cut him off before he could finish his words.\n\n\"No, this is different. I just need you to share some drinks with him!\"\n\n\"This is my last night. Please don’t ruin it. I trust and respect you so much.\" Michelle stood up to her feet. \"If you have nothing else to say, I’ll leave.\"\n\n\"That’s five hundred thousand dollars, Mika!\" Chester remarked, which made her freeze in her place.\n\nWhat? That much for a drink? Michelle thought.\n\n“That much, Ches?” She gave him a wide-eyed look.\n\nHer boss smirked.  “Of course. Your worth isn’t just a bare minimum, Mich. It’s just a few drinks and you’ll get the money. No sex required.”\n\nThe offer was indeed good, and whoever paid a lot for her time may have saved her years from another rat race.\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\nMichelle blinked, as she contemplated. It was a lifetime offer.\n\nShe couldn’t let it slide. Besides, it was only for a few drinks... After a minute, she finally made a decision. “Deal!”",

        "content": "Michelle’s mouth fell open seeing a gray limousine that picked her up in the parking lot. She could not help but wonder how rich her client was. So many thoughts started to swirl around her head. Sure, it was a one-time jackpot on her last night being a stripper!\n\nWhen the driver assisted her, she didn't hesitate to get in. But when she saw the familiar orbs of the man sitting comfortably inside the car, she was taken aback and her jaw dropped immediately.\n\nIt was none other than the man she had glanced at throughout her final performance. He looked totally hot as he sipped from his wine glass.\n\nHer gut twisted when their eyes met again. Even her heart seemed to have forgotten how to stay calm. His look made her want to swoon, but she knew it would only embarrass her.\n\nShe cleared her throat and sat next to him, ashamed.\n\n“I second thought you would reject my offer,” he said. His tone of voice echoed in her head. It was deep yet soothing, and enough for her knees to go jelly. “Would you like a drink?”\n\n“S-sure!” she answered hesitantly.\n\n“Your performance was great,\" the man remarked.\n\n“Here…” Michelle swallowed.\n\nShe nervously faced him to take the glass of wine. As soon as she felt his intense gaze on her, she became self-conscious about her outfit. She regretted wearing a spaghetti-strap dress since it showed her cleavage.\n\n“T-Thank you…” Out of nervousness, she instantly finished her drink in one shot.\n\nThe man chuckled, and the way he did it sounded like sexy music to her ears. It was a 15-minute drive. The limo stopped at a five-star hotel. As they walked to the hotel bar, her heart, and pulse raced. She had second thoughts but knew she’d regret not getting the $500,000 if she backed out. They went to the counter. Michelle sat next to him the whole time he was drinking. He offered her some drinks too, which she shyly accepted.\n\n“How young are you?”\n\n“It’s inappropriate to ask a woman about her age,” she said, a lame excuse she came up with as she didn’t want to tell him personal information about her.\n\nHe grinned boyishly. Michelle sucked in a breath. She couldn't deny he was stunning up close. Any woman would drool over him, even strip to attract his attention.\n\n“You look too young to perform like that in front of predators,” he remarked intently.\n\n“I am not as young as you think...”\n\n“Surely, given how you managed to slay in that performance. It was hot.”\n\n“And I will take that as a compliment,” she said shyly as she finished another drink.\n\nShe lost count of how many glasses of whiskey she finished. All she knew was that she already felt tipsy. When she turned to him, she noticed a ghost of a smile on his lips. He looked at her as if he could read her cover to cover.\n\nThe man leaned down until their noses touched. Michelle’s head was fuzzy yet she could feel the loud beating of her heart. She couldn’t think straight anymore. Her eyes dropped to his red lips. It looked soft, which made her lips part.\n\n\"Can I kiss you?\" he asked huskily.\n\nShe hesitated and blinked at his question, confused. But then she felt a burst of thirst. She licked her lower lip and then nodded. After that, he kissed her instantly.\n\n***\n\nMichelle could hardly pay attention to the room where she was. The only thing she knew was the man lay her down on a soft, comfortable bed. Heat coursed through her body, as though her soul was getting burned. The man went on top of her, planting soft kisses on her neck and clavicle.\n\nShe moaned, feeling his warm touches on her skin as it sent a triggering feeling from her stomach down to her groin area.\n\n“You taste like strawberry...” he huskily whispered. “I like strawberries now.”\n\nMichelle bit her lower lip. Her hands moved to caress his hair as if they have a life of their own. The man’s lips went up, claiming hers. She kissed him back passionately, even if she didn’t know how to do it as it was the very first time she had been kissed. And she never expected it to be so good... The man bit her lower lip which made her moan. She then felt his tongue trying to enter her mouth, which she willingly permitted. Her eyes were shut, surrendering to the heat and sensation that were engulfing her.\n\n“This dress turned me so fucking on. But you don’t need this right now,” he said.\n\nThe next thing she knew was they removed their clothes. Her sanity might have escaped somewhere as she didn’t feel any shame at all. In fact, she hurriedly removed her bra, exposing her full, large breasts in front of him. She saw him smile sensually; seemingly satisfied before he claimed the peak of her breast, while his other hand played with the other.\n\n“Urgh...” Her mouth formed an ‘O’ when she felt the roughness of how he sucked her peak as if he was a child craving it.\n\nThe man seemed to have a lot of experience when it came to sex. He kissed her again and it drove Michelle crazy. She could feel her entire body aching for more, wanting to delve deeper into this thing they were doing. She looped my arms on his neck; one hand travelled all the way to his robust back and caressed his every enhanced muscle flexing whenever he ground on top of her. His body was something to drool for, she had to say.\n\nIt was as if he had spent a lot of time working out in the gym to reach this kind of perfect masculinity. Michelle was so turned on that her hand travelled down to his ass, pinned it deeper against hers until she felt his manhood rubbed against that very spot. Her sex.\n\n“You are mine tonight,” he said before he finally took her.\n\nPain and pleasure enveloped not just her body but her mental state. It was breathtaking, making her reach the peak of her needs like she had reached Heaven for the very first time.\n\n***\n\nMichelle could feel the rays of sunshine blinding her eyes. Her brows knotted as she opened her eyes slowly. As she adjusted her vision by blinking and scratching her eyes, the first thing she saw was the open window with sunlight reflecting on it. She was about to yawn and stretch her arms, but then she felt a body behind her, which made her freeze at the time.\n\nShe slowly turned around, her eyes widening when she saw the familiar face of a man who she had accompanied last night. Michelle sucked in a breath, covered her mouth, and inspected herself. A pang of anxiety went through her when she realized that she was naked under the duvet. “What the!” she shrieked inwardly.",

        "content": "Life has been hectic for Michelle for the past two weeks. After graduating from college and paying off her father’s debt, she busied herself looking for a decent job. She submitted her application to three companies, but deep within, she prayed so hard that her dream company—Steinfield Company—would be the first to contact her.\n\nAnd it was like an answered prayer. Today, she received an email from them, and as she read the letter, she couldn’t help but be in tears.\n\nThey invited her for an interview this afternoon!\n\nMichelle let out a loud shriek, still not believing what she’d just read. She didn’t waste any time and prepared herself for today’s interview. She wore her best formal clothes paired with her oozing confidence. She reminded herself that she should not fail the interview, or else she would regret it for the rest of her life.\n\nWith a joyful feeling inside her chest, she went to the company to be interviewed. Her heart raced so fast when the cab stopped in front of what seemed to be a skyscraper building. She felt more excited as she walked into the front desk and asked one of the ladies where the human resources office was. After verifying that she had a scheduled interview for today, a lady assisted her to the elevator, and they went to the tenth floor.\n\n“Kindly wait for a few minutes. You will be interviewed by the company CEO himself,” the staff said, offering her a thin smile before she proceeded to the room where the interview was being held.\n\nMichelle inhaled heavily, settled into one of the seats outside the room, and calmed herself down. Her palms were sweating at this moment as she felt a little bit nervous.\n\n“You can do this, Mich.” She shut my eyes and uttered a small prayer. “This is your dream company. You can’t fail this one.”\n\n“Ms. Finley,” a soft voice called to her, which made her heart race faster this time.\n\n“It’s time. Please get in.” She nodded and cleared her throat, shoving all her worries aside.\n\nAs soon as she entered the room, Michelle chinned up confidently and gave the panel a polite smile.\n\n“Good afternoon, everyone,” she greeted them, taking a seat on the center aisle.\n\n“How are you, Ms. Finley?” “I am doing great, Madame. Thanks for asking!”\n\n“Mr. Steinfield, you can proceed with the interview. Ms. Finley here is ready,” the lady said, which made her glance at the man who was sitting next to her.\n\nIt must be the CEO of the company himself! The man’s swiveling chair was facing the wall, and she noticed his hand was holding her curriculum vitae.\n\n“Good day, Ms. Michelle Finley…” said the familiar voice of a man.\n\nMichelle thought she had heard his voice somewhere, but she couldn’t remember where exactly. But when the CEO spun around to face her, she froze in her seat. She saw his familiar marble-gray eyes...\n\nHow could she forget them?\n\nInstantly, her heart rate picked up, making her unable to breathe. The man stared at her intensely, which brought such terror through her body. His lips curled into a wry smile.\n\n“I want to know more about you. Would you mind introducing yourself?”\n\nMichelle could have sworn that her entire body fell into an instant panic. She couldn’t move or utter a single word. All she could do was stare at his familiar, God-like face as she recalled the fragmented memories of the night they shared.\n\n“Ms. Finley?”\n\nHer thoughts were ripped out when he cleared his throat.\n\n“Uhm…” Her gaze dropped. She couldn’t take the way he stared at her. “My name is Michelle Finley. I… I just graduated from California State University with high honors a few weeks ago and decided to submit my application here because this is my dream company.” She took a glimpse of him and saw that his index finger was brushing his lower lip. “As a fresher, I… I have no experience working in a related field—”\n\n“Interesting,” he cut her off. “Have you worked in an unrelated field then?”\n\nHis question made her very uneasy.\n\n“N-No, Sir...” she lied.\n\nShe wished the floor could just swallow her whole. Michelle could feel that her cheeks had just reddened in embarrassment.\n\n“So, you’re only twenty-two,” he stated, and a ghost of a smile escaped his lips.\n\n“Y-Yes…” she responded, lowering my head as she shut her eyes upon recalling how she refused to tell him her age that night.\n\n“Tell me, how can you be the best asset in my company?”\n\nMichelle did her best to collect the right words to answer the man’s question. But with the way he continuously looked at her as if he was remembering every bit of what happened between them that night, her mind literally went black.\n\nThis isn’t good, she thought.\n\nThey waited for her answer, but all she could do was shake and lower her head in shame.\n\n“Hmm, I guess I’m done here. She could take the exam,\" the man remarked before she heard him standing up and leaving the room.\n\n***\n\n“Why does it have to be him?”\n\nMichelle’s emotion welled up inside of her. She thought she had finally gotten away from the drunken mistake that happened weeks ago, but fate seemed to have played more evil this time around.\n\nEngulfed with worry, Michelle swiftly threw herself into bed when she got home. She caught Megan’s attention, who was on the other bed.\n\n“What happened, Mich? You looked so worn out.”\n\nMichelle recalled that her best friend had no idea what had happened two weeks before. She pondered whether she would tell her or not. She exhaled loudly and glanced over at Megan, who gave her a confused look.\n\n“Did the company reject you?”\n\n“No, it’s not that… well, they might reject me though,” she replied, palming her face in frustration.\n\n“There are lots of companies out there. Give yourself a break!”\n\nMichelle sat up in bed, biting her lip, and looked at Megan as if she were in big trouble. “Meg…”\n\nMegan tilted her head. “ You know, I've noticed that you've been acting strangely since you left your job at the club. I’m all ears, Mich.”\n\nShoulders slumped, Michelle huffed in defeat. “I’m going to tell you something, but please, if you want to judge me, keep it to yourself for now, because I’m really about to break down.\"\n\n“Try me.” Megan chuckled.\n\n“I had a one-night stand with a VIP customer on my last day at work.\"\n\n“What the heck?!” Megan beamed out, shocked.\n\n“Please, don’t look at me that way.” Her voice weakened. “It was a drunken mistake, okay? I… I didn’t know how it happened. That VIP customer offered a huge amount of money just to have drinks with me, and then the next morning, we were on the same bed, completely naked.”\n\n“Tell me it isn't true!”\n\n“How I wish it were just a wet dream, you know.” She winced as she recalled the pain that rose from the spot between her thighs when she woke up that day.\n\nJust by remembering the fragments of that one steamy night made her feel the familiar wetness at that very spot of her body, a reminder that she had really surrendered herself to that man.\n\n“I thought I could just forget that night, given that he was a stranger, but...” she paused, palming her face as she exhaled. “But it turns out that he’s the CEO of the Steinfield Company I applied for. That’s my dream company, and he just freaking interviewed me earlier, Megan. I’m so doomed!\"\n\nMegan shrieked in giddiness. “I can’t believe you’re no longer a virgin! Your life has gotten more exciting now!”\n\n“Stop, it’s embarrassing!” Michelle fought the urge to roll her eyes and lay down on the bed again to ponder her next steps.\n\nThe next morning, Michelle was determined to get the position she applied for at the Steinfeld Company. After receiving rejection letters from the other two companies to which she had submitted her application, her last resort to support herself was to beg her dream company to give her a second chance.\n\n“There’s no way I would see him every day at work. He’s a CEO, which means he’s a busy person. I just have to be careful not to cross paths with him, and I’ll be good. Fine, I’ll call HR.”\n\nShe was about to dial the main line for the Human Resources office of the company, but then she received an email notification from a familiar company email address.\n\nShe caught her breath as soon as she read the email.\n\n“I got accepted!”",

        "content": "“You will be the personal secretary of Mr. Ethan Steinfield, the CEO of this company.”\n\nShocked to hear it from the Human Resource Manager, Michelle could only gasp, still looking at the HR manager who briefed her about her position.\n\n“Ms. Finley?” She came back to her senses and blinked a few times.\n\n“Y-Yes?”\n\n“Were you listening?”\n\n“I am, I apologize,” she answered, trying to compose her thoughts.\n\nJust when she thought she could get away from the man she didn’t want to cross paths with, fate brought her into a nerve-wracking situation, again. But what choice did she have? She needed this job more than anything else. Her pride could not provide for her.\n\n“His office is located on the 78th floor. You can go up now and wait for the CEO to give you orders.”\n\nShe went out of the manager’s office and walked her way out of the Human Resources floor. Michelle walked past the group of employees who were having a conversation in one office cubicle.\n\n“There she is. I heard she blacked out during the interview.”\n\n“She’s not that qualified to be Mr. Steinfield’s secretary. I wonder what she did to get the position!”\n\nMichelle felt a pang inside her chest when she heard those comments from the employees. She wondered how she got accepted too, let alone became the CEO's personal secretary.\n\nWhen she finally reached the elevator, she pushed the button and composed herself. Michelle knew that she had more important things on her mind other than her co-workers' impression of her. One of them was the CEO.\n\nThe elevator door opened. She was about to enter when she became aware of the presence of someone, specifically the CEO, who was inside of it. Leaning his back against the cold metallic wall with his hand slid into his pocket, he looked at her sternly. Michelle gasped and lowered her gaze to avoid his intense stare.\n\n“Are you going to get in or what?” His domineering voice made her heart panic.\n\nShe got in the elevator and pushed the close button, wincing as she stood in the right corner in front of the buttons.\n\nWhy were they the only ones in the elevator, anyway?\n\n“Aren’t you going to greet your boss?”\n\nWithout looking at him, she spoke, “Good morning, Sir…”\n\nThe man chuckled a bit. “I thought I wouldn’t see you after that night. You disappeared into thin air as if nothing happened.”\n\nMichelle’s heart raced so fast. She swallowed so hard and licked her lower lip.\n\n“Sir, c-can we please be professional w-while at work?\" she stuttered and shut her eyes firmly.\n\nShe knew she wasn’t in the right position to ask for them to work professionally, but she still pushed her chance while she still had a little courage in her.\n\n“I’m quite impressed you’re asking me that, Mika.”\n\nMika! That was the nickname she used at the club. She then froze in place as she felt him step forward near enough for her to feel his cool, minty breath brushing against her neck.\n\n“After that night we shared, aren’t we supposed to skip formalities,” he remarked.\n\nHis voice sent shivers down her spine. Michelle caught her breath when she felt his hand rubbing her shoulder. Panic went through her, to the point that she rushed out of the elevator as soon as it opened on the wrong floor.\n\n***\n\n“I-I apologize for my actions, Mr. Steinfield,” she said, mustering her courage to utter those words when she went to his office.\n\n“How about you say that again while looking at me, Ms. Finley?” His menacing, deep voice made her hold her breath again.\n\nShe inhaled heavily and raised her head to meet his pair of marble-gray eyes.\n\n“I apologize for what happened, Mr. Steinfield. I didn’t mean to run away like that.” There she said it.\n\n“You ran away twice; in the hotel and in the elevator. Which one were you apologizing for?”\n\nMichelle’s whole body tensed but then she answered, “The one in the elevator, Mr. Steinfield.”\n\n“Hmm, that’s upsetting. I can’t forget what happened that night.” He breathed hard as he leaned forward, settling his arms on the desk. “How we had a very good time on the bed; how you moan because of my kisses.”\n\n“I didn’t come here to go down the memory lane of...” she trailed off, fisting her hand. “...of what happened that night. I can hardly remember it for I was drunk.”\n\nEthan stood up, walking towards her which made Michelle stiffen in her stance. She could only suck in a deep breath when she felt his warm hands on her shoulders as he stood behind her.\n\n“I can make you remember.”\n\n“No.” She moved away from him and glared at him. “Again, I... I didn’t come here for that.”\n\n“You have no idea how your angst gives me a boner.” He wryly smiled. “I can offer you more if you submit to me.”\n\nMichelle was quite hurt. She didn’t expect to hear such a vulgar offer from the CEO himself. Did he really see her as a cheap woman?\n\n“I apologize, Sir, but I want to work professionally. If it’s not too much to ask, let’s forget what happened that night.” She inhaled sharply. “It was a drunken mistake.”\n\nThe man’s expression turned grim, which made her legs wobble. However, seconds later, he spoke once again.\n\n“Interesting.” He licked his lower lip. “Since you asked that we keep being professional, I’ll try to pretend that that night didn’t happen.”\n\n“Really?” Her eyes widened.\n\nEthan’s eyes narrowed, and then he pointed his index finger to the right side of his desk, where there were piled-up documents. “Read all of those reports for me and create a summary report. I need it done before five o’clock.”\n\nMichelle frowned. It’s a thick pile of documents!\n\n“O-Okay, Mr. Steinfield…” was the only thing she said before she walked near his desk and took all the documents, and left his office.\n\nIt was a good thing that her desk was located outside his office. She huffed out loud and started reading those business proposals and reports, and it took her hours before she was able to come up with a summary she could submit.\n\nIt was nearly time to go home when she rose to her feet and submitted her initial task.\n\n“Is this all that you can give me?”\n\n“S-Sir?” Michelle looked confused.\n\n“I am not satisfied with this. Revise it, Ms. Finley. I need it polished by tomorrow afternoon!” Ethan’s voice boomed inside the office. The man exhaled and offered him a displeased stare. “Take it home with you and do not disappoint me tomorrow!”\n\n***\n\nBang! Bang! Bang!\n\nThe loud bang on the door had woken up Michelle. Fear struck her chest instantly as she heard the familiar unruly voice of an old man from the outside of their apartment. That woke up Megan too, and both of them looked at each other worriedly.\n\n“That’s your dad,” Megan said, swallowing hard.\n\n“I will get it.” Michelle gestured for her to stay on the bed. Michelle could feel her palms sweating as she walked to the door. When she tried to open it, she saw her father, who looked like a mess; too wasted and smelled of reek alcohol. “Dad? You’re drunk. What are you doing—”\n\nHe immediately grabbed her arms. Michelle flinched as she felt the pain in his grip.\n\n“Dad, let go of me!”\n\n“Goddammit, I owed a fucking a hundred thousand dollars. Give me some money now! I’m going to pay him! Come on!” he yelled at her.\n\n“What? But I don’t have that much money, Dad!”\n\n“I can tell you’re hiding money from me again!” He slapped her so hard that she fell to the floor. “Give me some money now!” Her eyes went teary. It wasn’t that long ago when she paid off his debt from the loan shark, and here he was, drunk and asking her for some money again!\n\n“Michelle!” Megan rushed towards her.\n\nSome of the people in the apartment building went out. Michelle felt more embarrassed as her father made a fuss in her supposed safest haven in the middle of the night.\n\n“Dad, please! Don’t make a scene here! I’m begging you!” But his father only looked at her angrily and even tried to throw her a punch if not for Megan who covered her.\n\n“I’m going to call the cops if you don’t leave, Sir!” Megan shouted.\n\nBut her father didn’t flinch a bit. “Didn’t you hear me, Mich? I said I fucking owe someone money. You have to give me some! Do you want your father to get killed?”\n\nTo her surprise, he shoved Megan aside. He grabbed Michelle by the collar of her pyjama top.\n\n“Dad, no! Please, don’t do this!” She gasped with pain, trying to remove his hands from her but he only gripped her tighter.\n\n“Again! Give me some fucking money!” he screamed out loud. Humiliated when the crowd started whispering about them, she had no choice but to nod in the end.\n\n“I’ll help you, Dad! B-But give me two days. I’ll find a way to get the money you need.” She sobbed. “I promise.”\n\nHer father grinned from ear to ear.\n\n“Just two days, Mich! I’m warning you. You have to give me the money or else I’ll disown you!” he yelled and then shoved her to the wall. “What a fucking useless child!” He then walked away.\n\nMichelle sucked in a breath, unable to stop her tears from falling.\n\n“Mich!” Megan held her immediately, engulfing her in a hug.\n\nPanic went through her, thinking that she agreed to give him a huge amount of money.\n\n“What should I do now, Meg? He needs a lot of money!”",

        "content": "“Is that a bruise?”\n\nMichelle came back to her senses and looked at the man in front of her. Even though there was a fiasco that happened in the apartment last night, she still forced herself to go to work as she didn’t want her co-workers, including the CEO, to have a bad impression of her. She tried to cover the bruise on the corner of her lips by using makeup, but it seemed like she failed to do it perfectly.\n\nEthan looked at her in an intense manner. “Where did you get that?”\n\nShe covered the bruise using the back of her palm.\n\n“This is nothing, Sir.” Then she put the summary report he needed on his desk. “Here’s the report that you asked me to submit. Please let me know if there are revisions I need to do.”\n\n“Did someone hurt you?”\n\nMichelle breathed in heavily. She didn’t want to recall what happened last night, yet her boss was making her remember the horrible event she wanted to forget.\n\n“No, Sir. Please, don’t mind me,” she told firmly. “Is there anything else you need me to do?”\n\nShe looked him in the eyes, and for a brief moment, she felt as if she got lost in them. But then she looked away as he gazed at her as if he was reading her thoughts.\n\n“I need a coffee,” he said and handed down a credit card on the desk. “Hot Cafe Latte.”\n\nMichelle gave him a nod and took the credit card before leaving his office. The company was only a few blocks from the closest coffee shop, which gave her a breath of fresh air.\n\nShe felt helpless. With a new debt, her father passed under her responsibility, she couldn’t function well. She was just eighteen when she had to work at the club to pay off his first debt. It was very traumatic. Just when she thought she could finally move forward, he brought her another storm to deal with.\n\nWhen she returned to the building with Ethan's coffee, she noticed a man causing a scene at the front desk. At first, she thought she was just hallucinating, but the man’s figure and unruly voice stiffened her.\n\nIt was her father!\n\nA surge of panic went through her when their eyes met.\n\n“There she is! That’s my daughter!” As her father stormed towards her, she felt her heart being hammered.\n\n“D-Dad, what are you doing here?” Her body started to tremble when her old man, looking enraged, threw her a deadly glare.\n\n“Where’s the fucking money, Mich?!” he shrieked.\n\n“Dad, please do not do this here. I’m at work…” she pleaded, severely panicking at this point.\n\nThe employees’ attention was drawn to them, but her father didn’t feel bothered; didn’t feel ashamed at all. Instead, he continued questioning her.\n\n“Michelle, don’t anger me more. Where is the money I am asking? Give it to me now!\" he demanded loudly.\n\n“I-I told you to give me two days, Dad!”\n\n“No! They will kill me if I don't pay them now! Do you want me to die?! Do you want to be fatherless?!”\n\n“For Heaven’s sake, I didn’t ask you to borrow money from them!” Michelle's emotions, especially anger, erupted at that moment. She cried and yelled.\n\nShe hoped her father would see his mistake and apologize, but he didn't. Instead, his eyes smoldered and his face reddened. “You bitch, how dare you to shout at me that way?!”\n\nHe raised his hand, and Michelle could only shut her eyes and wait for him to slap her so hard.\n\nBut it didn’t happen… She opened her eyes and saw that a hand had stopped her father from hurting her.\n\nHer eyes widened as she saw her boss, Ethan Steinfield.\n\n\"Who are you? Why are you harassing her?\" His deep and cruel voice sent shivers down her spine. His eyes showed fury, and all she could do was gasp.\n\nSilence engulfed the whole place. For the very first time in her life, Michelle was overwhelmed with both terror and anxiety. Who wouldn’t? Before her eyes were the sight of her father and her boss, both enraged as they gazed at each other.\n\n“Who the hell are you?!” Her father's question to her boss brought her back to reality. She tried to calm him by holding his other arm, but he shoved her again. “Don’t touch me, you worthless bitch!”\n\n“Dad, please… don’t make this hard for me!”\n\n“Then give me what I want! It’s pretty simple!”\n\n“It’s not that simple, Dad! I don’t have the means—” she gasped with pain, and couldn’t finish her words. She felt so damn low.\n\n“Can you please calm down, Sir? I don’t tolerate such behavior in my company,\" Ethan intervened. His voice sounded more like a warning.\n\n“This girl is my daughter, and I can scold her whenever and wherever I want!” The old man tried to get his hand off Ethan’s grip but to no avail. “Let me go!”\n\nMichelle froze. Seeing her father's crowd-pleasing fiasco, she wanted to vanish. She was completely ashamed, and could no longer control her emotions. She did nothing as she watched her father tarnish her reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethan called security, and, in an instant, two big men appeared on the scene and held her father in both arms.\n\n“Bring him to the conference room,” Ethan commanded. Michelle’s father shouted at the top of his lungs when the two security guards dragged him somewhere.\n\nShe sucked in a deep breath; her lower lip, her hands, and her knees were all trembling in fear and embarrassment. Worst of all, her boss witnessed it: her misery.\n\nThat part of her that she didn’t want anyone to see had been unraveled before his eyes.\n\n“Are you alright?” She only lowered her head, ashamed to even look at him. “Compose yourself, Ms. Finley. Come with me.” She heard him say before he followed his men wherever they brought her father.\n\nThe crowd whispered and made insulting remarks, embarrassing her. She sighed, wiped her tears, and started to walk after her boss.\n\nShe entered the conference room where they took her father. She couldn't hear any outside noise in the large, soundproof room. When the security guards left, Ethan held her shoulder, which caught her attention.\n\nShe looked at him, frowning.\n\n“How much did your father owe?” he asked in his cold voice.\n\nHer mouth dropped. “I... I am not entirely sure but—”\n\n“It’s a huge amount which that bitch can’t afford,” her father answered in grim.\n\nAnger went through Michelle’s veins. She worked as a stripper for four years to help her father pay off his debt. Still, he found her worthless.\n\n“Why are you so cruel, Dad?!” she shouted, releasing the unsaid emotions she had kept for the last four years. “After all I sacrificed to help you pay your debts, is this how you’re going to repay me? I fucking sold myself to the devil and I am still worthless?”\n\nMichelle’s father was furious. He was about to hit her again, but Ethan stopped him.\n\n“One wrong move and I will call the police,” he said warily.\n\n“You worthless bitch!”\n\n“Damn it,” Michelle whispered, frustrated.\n\n“Let me take care of this,” Ethan said when he looked at her.\n\nMichelle didn’t know it sounded like a promise to her ears. He then gestured for her to settle on the seat on the other corner of the long table.\n\nMeanwhile, he and her father sat down on the other side of the room. She couldn’t hear their conversation given that they were talking far away from her. However, at some point, she hoped for the best.\n\nAdmittedly, Ethan’s words soothed her and no doubt reached her heart. It was the first time someone stood up and helped her, aside from Megan. For the record, he didn’t judge her, but instead helped her sort things out. She felt saved. Michelle thought that Ethan was just like those perverted men she dealt with at the club. But no, he was completely different.\n\nThe feeling that a man was trying to help her made her stomach twitch, not in a negative way, but in a strange manner, she wasn’t familiar with.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethan questioned the old man, who didn’t feel any remorse after humiliating his own daughter. He clicked his tongue and began questioning him.\n\n“So, how much do you really owe?”\n\n“Why are you even asking? Are you going to donate some?” The old man sarcastically asked.\n\nEthan narrowed his eyes. “You have to tell me while you’re still at my mercy.”\n\n“And who do you think you are?” The old man gritted his teeth.\n\n“I can be your greatest enemy, Sir.” He smiled dangerously as he leaned his back against the backrest of the chair. “Now, answer me. How much do you owe?”\n\nMichelle’s father frowned. “A hundred thousand dollars.”\n\n“I can’t believe you humiliated her for that cheap amount,” Ethan remarked wryly. “I can take care of it, but I need something in return...”\n\n“What deal do you mean?” Ethan smiled and began discussing a certain deal with Michelle’s father, not wanting to fail with his plan.\n\nMichelle noticed that her father had become more relaxed while discussing something with her boss. She could see him smiling widely and nodding his head as if they had come to some sort of agreement.\n\n“I wonder what they are talking about,” she said to herself.\n\nMinutes passed, and both of them rose from their seats. That was the cue she’d been waiting for. She stood up and walked near them to find out how their conversation went.\n\n“What a great deal. You can have her. Oh, here she is...” Michelle’s father grinned from ear to ear when she stood in front of them.\n\n“What’s going on?” she asked, glancing between them.\n\nHer father laughed. “Ask your man here, Mich. If you’ll excuse me, I have to go.” He patted Ethan’s shoulder and gave him one meaningful look.\n\nMichelle’s curiosity was piqued when her father left the room. She then turned to Ethan. “What did he tell you?”\n\nEthan arched his brow. “I agreed to pay off his debt, but it comes with a deal.”\n\nMichelle’s forehead creased. She didn’t ask him to pay off his debt. The viciousness could be seen through his eyes and she felt intrigued.\n\n“A deal?” she asked.\n\nHe nodded in response, a devilish smirk curled on his lips.\n\n“Consider yourself sold, Ms. Finley. Your father agreed that I’ll pay off his debt, but in return, you will have to marry me.”",

The fact that the man still had the time to look so arrogant and gorgeous made her blood boil to a high level.\n\n“I swear you wouldn’t like to see me get insane.” He chuckled and continued, “You",

        "content": "Daniella watched as another of her pack was slaughtered by the intruder. The silver chains around her wrists, ankles, and neck stopped her from doing anything. Her alpha and his queen had already been killed in the invasion. She was originally from the city, but every month around the time of the full moon she travelled to the country to run with her pack.\n\nDaniella knew she shouldn’t really see the pack she ran with as hers. They only put up with her because Naomi and Jonathan demanded they did. None of the other members really liked her.\n\nStill, the open air of the city did not compare to the scent of the forest, the fresh grass, or the feel of other wolves, even if they were unfriendly. She had not found any other pack and wasn’t interested in being rejected at every turn, which was why she stayed where she was. Better the devil you know and all that. But now even that was being taken away from her as she watched members of her back being slaughtered by a man she didn’t know.\n\nShe was known as a half breed wolf, which meant she had been turned by having the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Working late at the advertising agency where she was a receptionist, Daniella had been bitten by a stray dog. At least at the time she’d thought it was a stray dog. Since being bitten she had learned differently. The large stray dog had turned out to be a wolf.\n\nSome packs frowned upon changing humans whereas others found their mates by biting humans. She didn’t have a clue why she’d been bitten, but Daniella had had to learn fast how to deal with being a half breed. If it hadn’t been for Jonathan, the now deceased leader, she would have died. The dog who’d bitten her had taken off, leaving her hurt and bleeding.\n\nJonathan and his wife, Naomi, had guided her through the transition until she was able to mingle with humans once again. Until she’d been bitten her life had been ordinary. She had never taken the time to relish her life or the simple pleasures she enjoyed.\n\nJonathan and Naomi helped her to adapt. Dogs had even stopped barking at her, and she had no choice but to sell her beloved cat. Having her pet hiss at her all the time was unsettling. So every month she would come back to the pack to embrace the destiny that had been thrust upon her.\n\nMost of the wolves in her pack wouldn’t have anything to do with her because of her not being a full blood wolf. She couldn’t change on demand and was bound by the restrictions of the full moon. Also, she was bigger than the other female wolves. Where the other wolves were slender without an extra pound on them, Daniella had plenty of pounds to spare. Running with the wolves hadn’t changed her weight at all. She didn’t mind as her body stayed the same even with her eating more. Her life had changed so drastically in the last eighteen months, and now she knew her life was going to change again.\n\nNaomi and Jonathan were dead, along with four other men and women. Their bodies lay in a corner as the man smiled menacingly out at the crowd. His pack stood behind him obviously prepared to take matters into their own hands if necessary.\n\nFear clawed within her stomach. In all of her life she’d never been the type of person to search for confrontation. The man who clearly was the alpha looked happy to tear apart members of her pack. Was he doing it for fun? She’d never seen him before and didn’t know what he had against her pack.\n\n‘Are they really your pack?’\n\nFor a long time Naomi hadn’t felt like a member of the pack. They put up with her, but no one wanted anything else to do with her. She was the only one who’d been turned by an unknown wolf, and they made sure their disgust was known to her. Neither Naomi nor Jonathan knew who turned her, but they’d been there when she needed them the most, and she felt a sense of loyalty to them.\n\nLicking her raw, chapped lips, she cried out as another man’s head was torn from his body. Her stomach turned. Leaning forward she could no longer contain the vomit she’d been trying to keep down. Everything she had consumed within the last few hours came up. The pack around her started to curse and move away.\n\nSomeone kicked her thigh sending her down to the ground. Fortunately, she didn’t land in her own vomit. When her stomach settled she stood once more to look at the stage. The silver from the chains hurt her skin. Glancing down she saw the red raw skin was bleeding in places from where the metal touched her. Wiping at her brow, she wished there was something more she could do.\n\nThe sound of a feminine scream interrupted her thinking. Daniella saw the only person who had been nice to her. The girl was no more than fourteen. Oliver was her name, and where the other pack members had ignored Daniella, the young teenager talked about her life constantly.\n\nDaniella found it strange that out of all of the pack, Oliver always smelled different, as if she didn’t belong. At times, Daniella was sure she and Oliver both smelled the same way, but no one said a thing about the young girl, at least that she heard. Watching the man haul the girl up onto the stage, Daniella had to look away.\n\nOliver wasn’t a bad kid. She was young, sweet, and hadn’t been polluted by other members of the pack. Oliver didn’t see full blood or half blood. The young girl saw people who happened to change into wolves. The innocence within her eyes was something to be cherished, not ignored.\n\nDaniella had been ignored most of her life. The only time she hadn’t been overlooked was when she’d been bitten. At twenty-five years old she’d not even had a sexual experience with a man. It was pitiful, but being a fuller woman came with its own set of issues. She’d been on the receiving end of cruel jokes, and she saw the real intent in the eyes of the men who asked her out. Daniella preferred to keep everyone at arms’ length rather than risk getting her heart broken or even crushed through bad decisions. Keeping her guard up allowed her to live her life in peace.\n\n“No, no, no, no, please. I’ve done nothing wrong,” Oliver said, begging for her life.",

        "content": "Staring down at the ground, Daniella felt the fear through to her bones. Oliver’s pleas were getting to her. There was no way she could let anything happen to the young girl. Glancing up, she watched as someone tugged on the chain around Oliver’s neck. The cries were too much, and before Daniella could stop herself, she’d shouted at them.\n\n“Leave her alone! She’s a young girl and has done nothing wrong.”\n\nHer voice carried through the air, travelling over the rest of her pack to land on the man doing the damage. Biting down on her lip, she heard the rest of her pack curse as their enemies turned to her.\n\nThe men had attacked before she had gotten a chance to get naked and run. Some of the pack were not that lucky and were, in fact, naked. Even though she’d been this way for the last eighteen months, Daniella hadn’t gotten used to seeing other men naked. She’d seen more cocks and breasts than she cared to remember in the last few months.\n\n“You speak out for this piece of sniveling trash?” the man asked.\n\nHe was the Alpha—and when he spoke, Daniella felt something answer within her. It was like her wolf knew his voice and was kicking at her skin, trying to get out. She didn’t have a clue who the man was. She’d never seen him before in her life.\n\nDaniella knew she would have remembered him from the way he looked alone. He was well over six feet, and down one arm going up to his neck was a black tattoo that interlocked and wrapped around his thick arms. The Alpha didn’t wear a shirt, only a pair of really tight jeans that settled on his hips but outlined his thick legs. He wouldn’t be put down easy in a fight, and every part of him oozed power and masculinity.\n\nDaniella hadn’t met another man like him. From his aura alone she was bowled over, and not just because she was bound within silver chains. Across the distance she couldn’t make out anything else other than the fact he was a giant hunk of a man.\n\n‘He’s killing your pack.’\n\n“She’s a girl,” Daniella said, forcing herself to speak up. If no one else would stand up for Oliver, then she would. There was no way to get out of here alive.\n\nThe man smiled, grabbing Oliver around the waist. “You want to bargain for her life?” the Alpha asked.\n\nDaniella nodded. Any confidence she had vanished as he ordered the man beside him to grab her. The rest of her pack tried to move away from her, hoping not to gain the wrath of the other pack. Crap. Why couldn’t she have stayed home and taken to the city woods?\n\nIt was guarded by high security, but she could have at least turned and gotten the run she craved. Instead, she’d come back to a pack who despised her, and now she was looking at the possible end of her life. The open air, the never-ending forests, and the scent of the waterfall attracted her more than the artifice of the city walks. She’d hoped to one day settle down away from the city.\n\n“Alex. I want her in one piece. I want to see who wants to bargain for this sniveling little pack,” the Alpha said.\n\nOliver whimpered on the stage. Daniella stared up at the one called Alex as he approached her. He looked deadly, with a scar down one side of his face. Alex had been the one to grab her from behind the trees as she was undressing. There hadn’t been any time to run, but she’d tried. He cut the links that bound her to the others.\n\nThere were only about thirty within their pack. The number had fallen as the dead bodies were amassing. Her arm was grabbed, and she was dragged to the stage. She didn’t know the proper etiquette when it came to pack men.\n\n“You will bow,” Alex said, forcing her down to her knees.\n\nGoing to her knees, she cried out as the silver seemed to pull on her wrists.\n\n“Well, you’ve got my attention. Now, what do you want?” the Alpha asked.\n\nJason stared down at the woman before him. The girl who she’d tried to bargain for—Oliver—was whimpering off in the corner. He really couldn’t give a shit about anyone in the pack, but this woman’s scent drew him to her. There was no evil on her person, whereas the rest of the whole pack was riddled with it. He wouldn’t be satisfied until all of them were fucking dead and he was burning their bodies to piles of ash.\n\n“Am I supposed to speak staring at the floor?” she asked.\n\n“What’s your name?” Jason asked.\n\nAlex had a hold of her hair as he pressed her to the floor. His man was putting on a good show, which Jason was proud of. All of his pack was doing the best they could in the current situation. He was holding his shit together.\n\nGlancing at the blonde girl behind him, Jason walked closer. The girl couldn’t be older than fourteen, and she didn’t have the same scent as the rest of the pack. Grabbing a chunk of her hair, Jason inhaled her fragrance. The girl was innocent, but she was still a member of the pack—and he’d made sure to rid the world of them.\n\n“I’m Oliver,” the girl said, looking terrified.\n\n“I’m not talking to you.” Turning away, he went to the woman bowed on the floor. Replacing his hand within her hair, he motioned for Alex to grab the girl. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Daniella.”\n\nShe had dark brown hair, and he noted it was silky to the touch. Even with his anger tightening inside him, he noticed the feel of her hair and the intoxicating scent coming off her as well.\n\nGlancing out at the crowd, Jason saw the anger and revulsion as they looked at the woman on stage. No one liked this Daniella, and it seemed she was the only one prepared to spare the youngest girl, Oliver. Lifting her head back, he stared into her dark brown depths. Her eyes were almost as dark as her hair. She was scared, but she tried to hide it.\n\n“You’re not a full wolf,” he said, inhaling her skin.\n\n“I was bitten coming out of work,” she said.\n\nHer hands were out on the ground, holding herself up. She bit her lip, clearly not happy with talking to him.\n\nHe returned his gaze toward the pack. They hated the fact they’d taken her in.\n\n“None of them care about you,” he said, lifting her to her feet.\n\nJason got a good look at her. Even if she’d smelled all wolf, he would have known she wasn’t. Her body gave her away. Full-blooded women were incapable of being full with lush tits like hers. Daniella had full hips, a rounded stomach, shapely thighs, and the largest rack he’d ever seen. He wondered what she looked like naked.\n\nJason didn’t have any bitches in his own pack. They were too much of a fucking problem with their territorial bullshit. He liked to fuck who he liked. Once bitches got involved, they started trying to gain his attention. The only women he accepted were those of his old pack—his sisters and mother were accepted even though they were part of another pack. Also, his men who were mated, their women were accepted into the fold, but he didn’t bring in any unmated females.\n\n“I don’t care,” Daniella said quietly. “Do not hurt Oliver. She’s done nothing wrong, and she’s too young.”",

        "content": "Wrapping his fingers around her neck, Jason pressed himself close to her body. His dick fitted against her ass. Her body was a thing of beauty, and Jason suddenly felt the desire to play with her. Looking at Alex he saw Oliver was perfectly still, waiting for whatever he decided.\n\n“If I spare her, what will you give me?” Jason asked, liking his plan more and more.\n\n“What do you want?” Daniella struggled against him.\n\nJason found her struggles addictive. He’d love to have her underneath him, struggling to get free. Only, she’d be crying out with the pleasure he gave her.\n\nRunning his hand down her body, Daniella paused as he stroked his fingers across her breast and then down over her generous hips. He wanted her naked, in his bed, up against the fucking wall Jason didn’t care as long as she was with him.\n\n“What do I want?” he asked, staring out over the hall.\n\nNone of them would miss Daniella, and he wasn’t a cruel man. Oliver didn’t know the shit her pack had caused, and sparing her wouldn’t hurt him. Alex was holding Oliver tightly, yet he wasn’t harming her. There was nothing vicious in the way he held onto her. They were not intentionally mean wolves. They were searching for justice.\n\n“Look at them, Daniella.” He made her voice a caress as he said her name. She tensed as he spoke her name. “They would rather see you slaughtered.”\n\nDaniella gasped, and he bent his arm around her waist, holding her close.\n\n“Oliver is innocent,” she said.\n\nHe was taller than she was, and he saw the tears spilling down her face. This pack may have allowed her to run with them, but none of them wanted anything to do with her. They’d rather see her burn than try to help her. His disgust was back again in full force.\n\nJason’s pack would accept her. They would stick together and make sure she wouldn’t be hurt. Being a woman bitten she wouldn’t have the same temperament as a full blooded bitch. They took care of their own. Even when his sisters stayed with him, his men respected them, took care of them, and made sure they were cared for. Jason trusted his men with everything, and because of that, he made sure to treat them with respect.\n\n“The question is, Daniella, what wouldn’t you do?” Jason asked.\n\nShe tensed in his arms, and he scented another smell from her, desire. The woman in his arms was attracted to him even as she was frightened. Smiling, Jason turned her to face him.\n\n“What do you want?” Daniella asked. Tears fell down her cheeks.\n\n“It’s quite simple, sweetheart. I will spare the girl if you agree to become my toy for the next month,” Jason said. He caressed her ass loving the way she quivered underneath his touch.\n\n“I can’t. I’ve got commitments.”\n\nHe nodded at Alex, who jerked Oliver harshly making her cry out.\n\n“Then I suggest you change your plans for the next month. I want you with me for one month until the next full moon. If I get anything less, she dies.”\n\nOliver whimpered, screaming as Alex tightened his grip on her again.\n\n“No, stop. I’ll do something. I agree,” Daniella said, shouting over the noise the woman was making.\n\n“You’ll agree to be my toy. To let me play with you whenever I want, however I want?” he asked.\n\n“Yes.” Her voice was breathless. Did she like the thought of being his own personal toy?\n\nJason looked forward to getting her to his home. All the things he could do to her made him yearn to get her home quickly without finishing what he’d come to do. His men could finish off what he started, and he’d be happy to get his woman in his bed. Fuck, his cock tightened at the thought of sinking into her tight, warm pussy.\n\n“Alex, do you have the girl?” Jason asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Good. Tie her together with this one. We’ll take them home when we’re done.”\n\nJason handed Daniella over to his man turning toward the crowd. Rage consumed him, and he knew what he wanted to do to rid his life of the fuckers.\n\n“Wait, what are you doing?” Daniella asked.\n\n“You asked to spare Oliver. Consider her spared. You never asked anything about the others. They’re going to die.” With them chained together it wasn’t going to be much fun.\n\nHe watched Alex wrap the silver chain around the woman. The steam rose from Alex’s hands as he touched the silver. His man would need some care when they got back to Jason’s house. Alex’s wife would take care of him.\n\n“No, please, spare them as well.”\n\n“No, baby. Not even the pleasure of your ass for longer than a month would let me spare them.”\n\nThe silver chain was wrapped around Oliver and then tied to one of the posts. There was no way the two women would escape. He didn’t know what he was going to do with Oliver, but he wouldn’t hurt her. Daniella had seen to that, and he wasn’t a bastard who went back on his word. His word meant something to him. Maybe he was a bit old school, but he didn’t care. No one would ever say he would back out on his word.\n\nTurning away, he gave the nod to his men to release the chains. Once the silver was gone, the pack turned into wolf form and ran. A few of them didn’t waste time to turn and had started running. Before he took Daniella to bed he needed to run off some of his energy. Otherwise he’d hurt her with the need to hurt that currently consumed him.\n\nHe counted to three, taking time between each number. His men were already turning, waiting for the right time to strike. Smiling, he spoke the final word and allowed the change to happen. Howling up to the moon, he chased after the first person that wasn’t part of his pack. The night was going to run red with the blood of his enemies.",

        "content": "“Why did you do that?” Oliver asked.\n\nThis was the first time Daniella had been close to the young girl. She always tried to keep to herself as she knew the disgust the other pack had for her. It wasn’t like her half breed blood was going to jump out and change the other members of the pack. She heard the sounds of the men and women as they ran for their lives. The pain coming from them in animal and human form scared the life out of her. She’d never heard anything so horrid as the sound of death.\n\n“Why did I do what?” Daniella asked, glancing at the blonde. Oliver was slender, beautiful, and would be a wonderful wolf one day.\n\n“Ask them to spare me? You’ve given yourself to that monster in order to save my life. I don’t understand.” Oliver’s eyes were red and swollen from crying. She winced every time the noise of a fallen pack member echoed throughout the night.\n\n“I did what I had to. You don’t deserve to die when you’ve not even lived. Whatever problem this pack has with ours, they’re not going to think about who they kill.” Daniella cried out as the silver worked under her shirt and banded around her waist. Why couldn’t she have developed a liking to silver rather than be allergic to it?\n\n“Try to stay still and it won’t itch,” Oliver said.\n\nNodding, Daniella stayed still to find the silver was uncomfortable but didn’t hurt anymore.\n\n“Thank you, and that is the reason why I had to spare you.”\n\n“Why? No one else would have. They act like nice people, but they wouldn’t have spared me.”\n\n“You’ve been nice to me, Oliver. I couldn’t let anyone hurt you. Put it down to me not being a full breed or blood or whatever it is you all call me.”\n\nThey were silent once again. The sounds of their fallen pack were getting quieter and fewer. There wouldn’t be any left within a few minutes.\n\n“I’m sorry about the rest of your pack,” Daniella said.\n\n“Don’t worry. I’m not. They probably deserved what is coming to them.” The anger in Oliver’s voice startled Daniella.\n\nWithin the hour Alex and Jason were back. Jason was buttoning up his jeans. The action was purely male, and her pussy pounded as a shot of lust struck her hard. The intense feeling startled Daniella making her tense. Oliver remained still, staring past Daniella’s shoulder.\n\n“Are you okay to bring Oliver to the house?” Jason asked.\n\nAlex nodded working the silver chain from around them.\n\n“I’m going to take Daniella. I’m sure we have much to discuss.”\n\nHer body was itching all over from the chains and also from the way Jason was making her feel.\n\n‘You’re his sex toy. You’re not here willingly.’\n\nShe tried to cut off all of her lustful thoughts about the man in front of her. Could her need for him have anything to do with her virgin state? Daniella hoped not. She wasn’t ready to fall for a man she didn’t know.\n\n‘You’re going to be having sex with him by the end of the night. Virgin no longer.’\n\nWhen she’d made the agreement to be with him, Daniella hadn’t thought about that little hiccup. Shit, she hoped it didn’t hurt. There was no way she could stand for him to know he would be her first. Probably her last, too, seeing as she never trusted a male’s company.\n\nThe silver moved up her skin creating a burning path of pain. Falling to her knees, she cried out as the pain got too much. Quickly the silver left her skin, and Daniella gasped.\n\n“Silver is not supposed to be like that,” Jason said, helping her to her feet.\n\n“I don’t suppose being allergic to silver as a human wouldn’t have helped.” She always had a severe reaction to silver jewelry and always had to go for gold or not bother at all.\n\n“As a wolf that pain would be magnified,” Jason said.\n\n“I guess.”\n\nThe silver fucking hurt.\n\nShe watched Oliver being led away and started struggling within Jason’s arms.\n\n“You’re not going to hurt her, are you?”\n\n“We have a deal. I keep my word.”\n\n“You’ve just slaughtered my entire pack. Forgive me if I don’t believe you.”\n\nJason threw his head back and laughed. The hand on her arm tightened. It didn’t hurt, but she knew there was no chance of escape. He would stop her from going anywhere.\n\n“It’s nice to know your bite hasn’t been taken from you.” He moved in close, inhaling her scent. “God, I can’t wait to see if your pussy is as tight as I imagine.”\n\nCrossing her legs, she glared at him.\n\n“Crossing your legs is not going to keep my dick from you. You’re going to have me everywhere.” His hand moved to her ass, gripping her flesh tight. “Your ass, mouth, cunt, and tits are all mine.”\n\n‘Don’t be turned on.’\n\nShe was a virgin, but she wasn’t immune to the lust. Since she’d been bitten, the sexual urges within her had grown strong. There was nothing she could do to stop the cravings. Those very same cravings had forced her to start buying porn movies in an attempt to find some kind of release with her own hand. In the last year alone she imagined she’d masturbated more than in the whole of her life. At twenty-five years old it was quite pitiful.\n\n“Ah, I see you like the sound of that.” Jason leaned in close pressing his nose against the curve of her neck. If he was to bite her neck he’d kill her.\n\nHer pulse pounded, and she tried to calm down. If he was to take a chunk out of her neck he’d take a major artery, and being a half breed she wouldn’t be able to survive such an attack. She hoped he would take into account her more human side.\n\n“You want my dick, don’t you?”",

        "content": "Licking her lips, she stared past his shoulder wishing there was something else she could be doing.\n\n“You’re not going to answer. I can live with that. I’ll have you begging soon enough.”\n\nTogether they walked out into the night. The warm air washed over her, and she gasped. The scent of the night air called to her wolf, begging to be released. This was the first time she’d kept her change within her. The moment the full moon was high in the night sky she liked to change.\n\nThe next three days were important to her as it kept the sickness at bay. When she hadn’t turned one month because she could no longer stand the treatment of the pack, she’d been ill for the entire month. Work had been horrid as she couldn’t stand the noises and scents. The only way she could keep focus was if she turned every full moon.\n\n“Your pack were assholes,” Jason said, taking her away from the open land toward the tree line.\n\nShe heard the sound of the flowing water of the river and waterfall she knew was there. The first time she’d found it, Daniella hadn’t left the waterfall for the entire weekend of the full moon.\n\n“What are you talking about?” she asked, trying to keep up with his pace.\n\nHe was well over six feet, and she was struggling to keep up with his long strides at her own five foot six.\n\n“There are ways and means to keep the wolf at bay. There are half breeds out there who cannot turn every full moon. They have ways and means to handle themselves. Running, working out, even taking a cold water bath can help with the cravings.”\n\nDaniella hadn’t heard of other ways. Looking back none of the pack wanted to talk to her. Jonathan and Naomi had been nice, but once she controlled the turning and knew what she was doing neither of her leaders offered any advice.\n\nIn fact, besides Oliver, no one spoke to her at all. It was like she didn’t exist to anyone. They kept the small room at their house for her to stay in, but she felt more like a pet than a member of the pack. Shaking her head, she kept up with Jason’s paces.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said. “No, you wouldn’t.”\n\nShe recognized where he was going as they walked up the incline of the forest. He was taking her to the top of the waterfall. Daniella concentrated on climbing. Before long she felt out of breath. Jason kept hold of her arm leading her up to the top.\n\n“I don’t trust your wolf, and it’s time for you to know how to control your wolf. Some of the half breeds can’t even wait to the full moon before turning.”\n\nWhen they got to the top she looked down at the water below.\n\n“Why are we here?” she asked.\n\n“It’s time for you to know how to handle yourself.”\n\nBefore she could ask what he meant, he pushed her over the edge. Screaming, Daniella panicked seconds before she plunged into the water below. Jumping over the edge, Jason followed her down. He’d met a half breed in the city, and they’d become close.\n\nDuring their time together, Jason asked the man how he’d stopped himself from the turning. The man had been bitten by a female wolf. She’d helped him through the change, but she’d been turned out by her pack for turning a mate. Jason didn’t have a problem with half breeds, and he was friends with the young couple. They were not part of his pack as neither of them wanted to be part of a pack.\n\nAnd he knew he’d be coming a lot more to jump over the edge. Daniella screamed out, pushing the hair out of her eyes. Laughing, Jason dipped down. The water wasn’t cold as it was turning out to be one of the hottest Augusts ever. He loved the heat as it meant not many clothes needed to be worn.\n\nThe one thing he hated about life in the city was the fact he had to wear clothes to work. Jason loved being naked, and even though he could afford not to go to work, he’d go insane if he wasn’t kept busy. Working in a busy office kept him driven and also challenged him with the noises and scents. He’d fucked plenty of women in his office, and he’d picked them out because of their response to him. The scent of a welcoming pussy drove him insane.\n\n“What the fuck were you thinking?” Daniella asked, screaming.\n\nHe swam over to her, wrapping his arms around her, laughing. “What a rush.”\n\n“I could have died.” She hit him hard. “I’m not some fucking rag doll you can test to see how much you can do until I break. I’m human!”\n\nTaking hold of her face, Jason forced her to look at him. “Is your wolf begging to get out? Are you struggling to keep the little bitch contained?”\n\nShe paused in fighting him.\n\n“See, she’s not there, is she? You can think without having to deal with her clawing her way out of you.” He stared into her eyes knowing what he said was the truth.\n\n“How? Only allowing the change has done that.” She was swimming with him without trying to get away.\n\n“You gave your body the same rush the wolf needs. You’ve put her to bed. I’m not saying it will last, and I wouldn’t advise jumping off a building onto concrete, but there are ways and means for you to survive without turning.”\n\nDaniella ran her hand over her face pushing the loose strands of hair out of the way.\n\nStaring into her dark brown eyes, Jason wanted to see those eyes begging him to fuck her. Taking hold of her arm, he moved toward the edge and climbed out, picking her up out of the water. The shirt she wore clung to her curves, showing off the hard buds of her nipples. What would she taste like?\n\nNo, he wasn’t going to have a taste of her now. He scented her innocence, and taking her outside wouldn’t be the best idea he had.\n\n“It’s time for us to go.”",

Jason had planned the attack long ago, and tonight he’d made sure to hide any scent of his approach with the fumes from the car. Wolves wouldn’t have suspected anything from cars.

This man who owned her for the next month clearly had plenty of money to back his pack.\n\n‘He wiped out your pack.’\n\nOliver was safe. Daniella could cope knowing she’d saved the young girl. What was she going to do when the month came to an end? With no pack she wasn’t welcome to just any pack. Several would hurt her at the very least, or even kill her. Crap. She didn’t even know if she wanted to join another pack.\n\nLife as a half breed was already hard seeing as she couldn’t talk with anyone about the problems she encountered, like the heat she suffered. Reaching out, she touched Jason’s naked arm. His flesh was firm and hard to the touch. Taking her arm away, she felt like her fingers were on fire.\n\nHe looked at his arm and then at her fingers, smirking. “Baby, I’m going to be buried balls deep inside you",

Nothing he said or did would make her feel any better or any worse. She really thought she’d be able to get away with it. At twenty-five years old she assumed she wouldn’t feel a thing.

If looks could kill she’d be nervous.\n\n“Helen, that’s enough,” William said, speaking up. “We’re going to have breakfast, and then we’re going to leave them to their business. This is not our pack, and it’s not our business.”\n\nThe hairs on the back of Daniella’s neck stood on end. The Alpha within William was demanding obedience.\n\n“I know. I know. You don’t have to go all Alpha on me.” Helen tapped his cheek as she passed.\n\nAll she wanted to do was get breakfast over with as fast as she could. Picking up her fork, she tensed when she felt Jason sit beside her. He made no move to speak to her, which she was thankful for.\n\nDuring the breakfast Helen spoke of Jason growing up, the good old days of being kids. She was given a rundown of embarra",

How can a half breed ever have a place in your pack? You’re an Alpha, Jason. You’re not a half breed or a lower member or whatever. I don’t even understand wolf politics,” she said, arguing her point.\n\nCupping her face, he leaned down closing the gap between them. He caressed her lips with his own, stroking along the plump softness until he plundered her mouth with his tongue. She met him, caressing him back.\n\nJason felt his blood boil. The feelings built inside him to a fever pitch. Daniella was his woman. Her wolf was a perfect match for him.\n\n“You can’t kiss me to make the problems go away,”",

His scent surrounded her, and in the last the few days she’d found his scent calmed her nerves.\n\nEvery now and then her stomach would turn and her wolf felt close to the surface, and that alone scared her. Whenever Jason was with her the wolf within would settle. She was starting to wonder who the actual master of her was, herself or Jason.\n\nHe stood beside her dressed similarly in jeans and a shirt. At first Daniella had been horrified by their lack of formal clothing. Jason had laughed, reminding her that they were going to a room full of wolves.\n\nThere was no need for formal clothing.

        "content": "Families always have problems, I know that. Mine just seemed to have more than most. My uncles had all spent time locked up and now they couldn’t get work. My mother was a drunk and my dad had never been in the picture. To say we were dysfunctional was an understatement.\n\nSomehow mom had managed to buy the house we were in. It was small, just a few bedrooms and a kitchen/living area. It was full of people, though.\n\nWe became the crash pad for anyone in the family with nowhere to stay, which was pretty much everybody. They blamed the bad economy. I blamed the stuff they kept snorting up their noses. Fear of another beating kept me from ever saying anything like that.\n\nI’d had my own bedroom until my last uncle moved in. Uncle Eddy told mom he “needed” to have a comfortable bed. He was creepy enough he probably wouldn’t have cared if I stayed. My mother told me I could sleep on the couch, but she spent most nights there passed out drunk. Occasionally I found myself sleeping in a chair on the front porch.\n\nIt was a shock when I managed to graduate high school.\n\nOnce I finally turned eighteen I’d got out of there as fast as I could.\n\nI took a job cleaning rooms several hours down the interstate in a seedy motel. My boyfriend drove me and my meager belongings to the motel. His payment was a quickie on the motel’s squeaky, uncomfortable bed. Once he left, I never saw him again.\n\nThe manager at the motel was not exactly nice, but he took my money same as anyone else’s to stay there. I had my own bed and a little TV. I did the cleaning, so it was spic and span. Soon I learned to avoid Mr. Pensky, the manager, just like I’d avoided my uncles.\n\nThe work at the motel was hard and thankless. Mr. Pensky refused to buy me even simple things, like gloves. My hands were red and raw from the chemicals I used. After a couple months the dry cracks over my fingers and palms just became part of me.\n\nThe motel’s clientele were mostly old grimy men. They tried to grope me daily, but I was fast. I’d learned years ago how to avoid my uncle’s unwanted touches. I kept myself out of trouble.\n\nThe basics of living at the motel were still an improvement. I had food three times a day. For once, I could lock my room, so nobody stole what I bought. I rarely had fresh fruit or vegetables, canned foods kept better and were cheaper. I knew I couldn’t eat like that forever. It was still an upgrade for me, though.\n\nI loved my days off. I took the bus and went down to the coast. There was a place there the tourists never went. If you climbed the steep slope down, you had your own private rocky beach.\n\nI’d spend hours diving and exploring the deep bottom. It was quiet under the water and the fish never bothered me. I learned to hold my breath a really long time and explored the underwater caves and crevices as far as I could.\n\nIf I ever got enough money together, I considered taking scuba classes and renting the equipment. That kind of cash was long way off for me.\n\nThat was life for me and I was finally happy. My little world wasn’t very exciting, but it was mine.\n\nI shopped after work at the mini mart a block away. I came back to the motel late one night and noticed a faint glowing coming from around back. I dropped my groceries in my room and went to investigate.\n\nThere was a small wooded lot behind the building. Drunks sometimes started fires back there. The manager didn’t care unless they got out of hand and then we called the police and fire trucks.\n\nI’m not sure what prompted me to go investigate. I should have gone and gotten Mr. Pensky and let him check.\n\nI crunched into the lot stepping over empty beer bottles and discarded syringes. The light was coming from somewhere in the center. I wove between the trees watching the light. It wasn’t flickering like a fire. It was more like a steady pulse. That’s the last thing I saw on Earth.\n\nI woke up and didn’t really remember having gone to sleep. My surroundings were all very clean, sterile almost and completely foreign to me. I bolted upright and realized I was naked.\n\nThe room I was in was bright white including the little bench I had been laying on. There were no windows in the room and the light seemed to be coming from the walls themselves. I put my feet on the floor and it felt like hard plastic. Reaching out and touching the walls I couldn’t find anything like a seam that would indicate a door.\n\nMy breathing was coming rapidly and I figured this must be hyperventilating. Suddenly it felt like the room was moving, the sensation was slight, but prominent. My arms and legs were stuck, held in place by strong air currents. The air pulled my arms out from my sides and separated my legs. I turned my head and saw the bench blend back into the floor.\n\nThe walls just disappeared, that’s the best way I could describe it. One minute they were there and then they weren’t. I was on the white lighted platform looking out into oblivion.\n\nMy eyes slowly adjusted to the dark and now I could see faces. My little platform was drifting slowly through a sea of faces. They were humanoid, most of them. Others were what people described when they talked about alien abduction.\n\nI fought for consciousness. My mind just wanted to shut off and be back at the motel fixing Ramen noodles. This could not possibly be happening.\n\nI was so humiliated. I wasn’t fat, but I wasn’t skinny either. My tummy and hips had a soft look I hated. The same went for my enormous breasts. I longed to cover up all my private parts.",

        "content": "The thing that really bothered me. The thing that should not have mattered that did was that I hadn’t shaved my legs or my armpits in ages. There was no one to impress at the motel, so I was a hairy mess.\n\nMy bush, oh man, my bush was huge reaching all the way to my navel. The dark curly hair covering my lower stomach was a trait I had inherited from mom. I hated it and I never would have showed it to anyone. Not like any of that mattered, but my brain decided that’s what I would worry about.\n\nOccasionally, my little tray would pause in front of a group of faces. The ones that I stopped in front of all looked human. I seemed to glide right past the strange looking creatures in the hall. I couldn’t wonder why that was.\n\nThe groups of men I hovered in front of appraised me. I could see them pointing at me and talking to one another. Depending where they pointed the light and the air currents changed. I was bent over, laid flat, made to sit, and made to kneel. I couldn’t fight the air currents, they were too strong. The light seemed to illuminate the part of me they were most interested in.\n\nIn one position I saw other dully lighted trays lining a raised stage on the far side of the room. Other creatures adorned those trays. All were held in a position similar to mine. A human looking woman was passing between them on the stage, placing collars around their narrowest part. It struck me we were being sold, this is what an intergalactic slave house would look like.\n\nIt was intolerable that humans were enslaving other humans. They should know this was wrong. Suddenly, I was livid.\n\nThis was insufferable. The last group of men had the air currents move me all over the place. The nerve they had to treat me like this. The auctioneers would probably kill me for my bravado, but I didn’t care. I was furious.\n\nI tried to scream at the men in front of me. Initially no sound came out, some weird air current was preventing it. I glared at them and resisted the air currents. I wasn’t going to just be the puppet they wanted.\n\nOne of the males in front of me had long dirty blonde hair down his back, he smiled smugly at me and motioned. The air current preventing me from speaking was gone and I made the most horrible noises. I called them every bad name I’d ever heard and cursed them in every way I could think of. I struggled against my bonds and glared at them.\n\nThe men talked amongst themselves for several moments while I floated in front of them. I had run out of cuss words, so I just scowled in their direction. I looked around angrily and wondered which group of ass holes I would stop in front of next. Hopefully these jerks were done with me.\n\nA massive dark haired man in the group made a motion and shouted something out. The air current over my mouth returned and my platform spun across the room to the wall. The light under my feet dimmed until it was just a dull glow. Humanoid hands placed a cool metal collar around my throat.\n\nOh God, what had I done?\n\nI watched with terror as the auction continued. Despite all the activity, my eyes were glued to the last group of men I had stopped in front of. It appeared the dark haired man had bought me.\n\nI tried to recall exactly what he looked like. It was hard to see him from this distance. He had been large and muscular, I thought. His chest seemed to have a metal breast plate squarely in the middle. I seemed to remember seeing the hilt of a sword at his waist. All in all, he looked dangerous.\n\nI looked away from him for a moment and checked out the other slaves. Some look sort of human, but most didn’t. In fact, I didn’t see anyone else up here on the stage that appeared to be from Earth.\n\nScanning the auction again I didn’t see the dark haired man anymore. I had a moment of panic that he had left. If he hadn’t bought me, who had? The not knowing was worse than knowing.\n\nA movement from by my feet caught my eye and I looked down. The dark haired man was there, along with the four other men and they were staring up at me. Their eyes seemed to be appraising me. I was acutely aware of how my legs were spread and what they had complete access to.\n\nIn my fright, my body did the most embarrassing thing. I pissed myself. The golden liquid splashed down my legs to the white platform.\n\nThe men looked at it curiously and seemed to be discussing it. The one with the long blonde hair reached onto the edge of the platform. I felt the air currents fighting him, trying to push him away. He wasn’t even a little deterred and dipped a finger into the yellow puddle. He examined it, as did his friends, and then he tasted it.\n\nBad enough to piss myself in public, now some alien is tasting it.\n\nThe female looking creature that had collared me came to stand beside the men. They looked warily at her. A long tentacle came out of her throat and delved into the ear of the long haired man. She was impassive, but the man bowed his head to her. She motioned and my little platform was clean of the puddle. The urine still clung to my legs and I wished the air currents would dry it.\n\nThe men stood at my pedestal talking and occasionally looking up at me. The questions plagued my mind. Had Dark hair bought me? What would they want me to do? Were they going to eat me or beat me? I felt nauseated and wanted to throw up. Then that would be stuck to me too, so I held it in and tried to breath normally.",

        "content": "I barely noticed the motion as my platform moved backward into a small room. The room was dimly lit and the walls looked like large screens. My arms were trembling from being held out so long and I was slumped against my invisible bonds. For the moment my adrenaline was exhausted and so was I.\n\nThe five men walked casually into the room while the lady with the tentacle followed them.\n\nThe wall in front of me lit up and it was me, for all practical purposes with no hair. I screamed into the air mask and struggled in my bonds. For some reason it seemed like shaving me bare would be the worst thing they could possibly do. Obviously I knew that was just the beginning.\n\nThe dark haired man turned around and watched me struggling. His face was rough with stubble and his short black hair framed his face. He raised a dark eyebrow and said something. Long hair jumped up on my platform behind me. I felt him grab my long brown hair and wrap it around his fist. He twisted my head to and fro talking to his friends.\n\nHe jumped down and leaned casually on my platform smirking up at me. The tentacle lady hit a switch and the me on the wall was now just like I was, hair and all. A sigh of relief escaped my mouth. Suddenly, I realized it had come out. The air mask on my face was gone.\n\nThe men spoke to the lady in a language I couldn’t understand. Dark hair continued to watch me intermittently. I wasn’t really upset when the me on the wall had her leg, groin, stomach, and underarm hair removed.\n\nA lanky quiet man pointed to his breast plate and addressed the group. The metal covering his chest had an intricate design on it. In fact, they all wore the same design on their chest. The lady stuck her tentacle into his ear.\n\nI was distracted from the rest of the conversation as the long haired man played with my toes. Across the platform from him a man with brown hair and a short beard stroked the other foot as they talked. They were touching me without permission and it infuriated me. The logical little voice in the back of my mind reasoned I should get used to it.\n\nTwo creatures came in to the room from the side door. They looked like they were made of jelly. Again, the urge to throw up came over me and I fought it back down.\n\nThe platform I was on lowered to the ground and I was now surrounded by my captors at their level. The men were enormous, the shortest was probably six foot something. At 5’7 they dwarfed me substantially.\n\nThe jelly creatures were on the platform now and I started to struggle. Of course I already knew it was worthless, but I couldn’t stop. When the jelly creatures started to engulf my legs, my panicked screaming filled the room. Quite suddenly the air mask over my mouth was replaced and the tentacle lady was sticking her thing in my ear.\n\n“Silence, slave,” I heard in my mind. “You are now the property of the proud warriors that stand around us. They wish your hair removed in certain places and it is being done. They have paid to have an understanding of their language placed in your mind. I will do this now.”\n\nMy world got foggy as tentacle woman dumped an alien language into my brain. I was vaguely aware that the table moved up as I moved down until I was lying flat at the level of the lady’s tentacle. It felt like I had had too much to drink. Slowly the words being spoken around me started to make sense. There wasn’t time to marvel at it, though.\n\nThe tentacle woman pulled out what looked like a silver pen light and pressed it to my arm. I winced as a slight burn started where she held the silver pen against me.\n\n“What was that?” the lanky guy asked quietly.\n\n“It is for the slave’s health,” the dark haired man answered him. “Basin told us of this, brother, you must pay more attention.”\n\n“We will give it a drink every day that is similar to that concoction,” the bearded man said and the others agreed.\n\nIt was so weird understanding a language I knew was foreign to me. I was stunned.\n\n“Human slave, I am speaking to you in the language of Pateria. Do you understand me?” the woman asked looking right at me.\n\nI nodded slowly and she slapped my breast, “You will answer me when I speak to you, slave!”\n\nBefore I had a chance to do what I was told, I saw Dark hair grabbing her hand.\n\n“This one is ours now, saleswoman. Respect it as such,” he said rubbing a hand over the mark hers had made. My nipple responded to his touch despite my sense of dread.\n\n“They are protective, slave, you are lucky. Now do you understand me?” she asked again.\n\nI answered her in a slurred voice with words I barely recognized and the men came to stand around me. I realized I was laying down across the platform and the jelly creatures were still at work. The slimy burning was running up my legs.\n\nDark hair gazed down at me. He trailed his fingers along my arm as he addressed the saleswoman. “We wish to know how it works. When the cleaners are done, I want you to show us all the parts,” he said turning his gaze back on my face.\n\nI still felt drunk and the room started to slowly blacken around the corners. I wondered how many parts she would show him. Would she open up my belly to show him those parts, too? On that lovely note, I blacked out.\n\n***\n\n‘Bad dream,’ I thought to myself as I woke up. ‘Hope I didn’t miss my alarm.’ I opened my eyes and then shut them tight again. Inside my head I repeated to myself, ‘bad dream, bad dream, bad dream.’\n\n“I already saw you Ciara, you opened your eyes. You aren’t asleep anymore. I wish to look at you with them open,” the long haired man said.\n\nHe had been leaning over me watching me sleep. I had seen his piercing blue eyes the minute I opened mine.\n\n“I could open them for you, Ciara. Should I do that?” he asked.",

        "content": "I threw my eyes open and tried to move away from him, but only ended up backing into dark hair who had been laying on the other side of me. I scooted away from both of them and fell off the surface we had been laying on. Crawling across the floor I stopped when I hit the wall and stood up.\n\nGlancing out an opening in the wall I noted the sun that was peeking over the purple blue horizon. Several large moons could also be seen stretched out in the sky. I’d never seen a sky that color or with that many satellites.\n\nI turned in stunned silence and gazed sightlessly ahead. This wasn’t earth, unless my planet suddenly sprouted new moons. I was somewhere different, somewhere very far away. My eyes started to work again and I took in the details of where I was.\n\nIt appeared to be a bedroom. In the center of the room sat a huge circular bed covered in an assortment of deep blue covers. A large pole ran up the middle of the bed and attached the ceiling. Four powerfully built men were lounging on it. From the look of their hair, they had just woken up.\n\nThe lanky man was laying on the other side of the mattress. He stretched languidly and watched me.\n\n“I told you we should have tied it up,” the lanky man said to the group in general.\n\nI whimpered and hugged my arms around myself. My butt naked self, I realized. Looking down quickly I saw ornate metal cuffs wrapped around my wrists and ankles, but was otherwise I was completely unclothed. I shifted my arms to cover my private parts.\n\n“To the first contest then,” the broad, bearded man said rising from the bed and coming toward me.\n\nThe bearded man was taller than me by at least a foot. His chest was bare except for the copious amounts of thick bronze hair. A fine piece of white linen was wrapped around his waist. From the number of scars that cut across his torso he had obviously been in a lot of fights. He terrified me.\n\n“Master Evan wishes to inspect you on the bed with your eyes open, Ciara. Go back and lay down,” he commanded.\n\nThe man was a giant. I was too scared to move and shook my head ‘no’ watching him.\n\n“What do you mean when you move your head like that? Speak to me, Ciara,” he said coming closer.\n\n“No,” came out of my mouth.\n\n“No what, Ciara,” he said folding his arms across his chest. He watched me tremble for a moment and then continued. “You are not educated, so I will help you. When you answer myself or my brothers, the word master should follow whatever you say.”\n\n“You are not my master,” I hissed at him mutinously.\n\nThe bearded man stepped closer to me and I bolted away from him. I didn’t make it far. In my haste to escape, I didn’t notice the long haired man as he stepped in front of me. Fighting wildly, I fought the hands that restrained me. After a quick struggle, I ended up subdued on the floor.\n\nThe long haired man held me face down with my hands behind my back. He had my right arm twisted in a grip so strong I feared the bone would break. Screaming apologies I lay still, praying he would release me.\n\n“That was a horrible noise, Ciara,” the bearded man commented.\n\n“I apologize, Master,” I sobbed, grateful the long haired man had suddenly freed my arm.\n\nThe bearded man spoke to the long haired man sharply then, “Use less force, Evan. You act as though we have not been trained.”\n\nThe man named Master Evan pulled me to stand as he grunted an apology to the bearded man.\n\n“It ran at me,” he said, “I was surprised.”\n\nI stood and trembled between the two men. Powerful did not begin to describe them. Despite my objections the long haired man, Master Evan, had quite simply moved me to the floor like I wasn’t fighting him. My arm throbbed as a vivid reminder of how not to act.\n\nThe men were looking at me and I realized I had been staring at them.\n\nI wasn’t sure how I had ever confused them for human. For one, they were too tall. Secondly, their eyes were different, larger and more feline. Their skin also should have told me, it was very faintly striped gold and golden brown. There were subtle and distinct differences between us.\n\nI dropped my eyes, but not before taking in Master Evan’s complete form. He was tall and his muscles were well defined in his arms and chest. Like the bearded man he also had a good number of scars that cut across his body. Unlike the bearded man he had less chest hair.\n\n“Your eyes are green, Ciara. None of us have green eyes,” Master Evan said conversationally.\n\nI had no response to that but looked up at his face again. Master Evan had a lopsided smile on. He was just intently watching me. For a man that had nearly ripped my arm off, he seemed almost good humored.\n\nThe bearded man was standing watching me also, but seemed to have deferred the conversation to Master Evan.\n\n“What is Ciara? Why are you calling me that? My name is Rachel,” I said to him in a pleading voice.\n\n“That’s twice you didn’t follow instructions, Ciara. I would be happy to answer your question if you apologize for not addressing us properly. Be forewarned, the punishment will only get worse the longer you defy us,” he said in that pleasant tone.\n\nThe lanky guy on the bed spoke before I had the chance to. “Liam told me the first they did with their slave was take it down and show it the whipping post. He told me they strapped it to the post and left it there half the day, after that they had no problems.”\n\nI’d been beaten by my mother and her brothers on more than one occasion. These guys were much tougher than my family. I had no urge to repeat an experience like that ever again.",

        "content": "“I’m sorry I didn’t call you master, Master. Please, tell me where I am. Why are you calling me Ciara? Why am I here? I’m sorry, Master.” I stumbled all over my words and looked at the floor.\n\nTears started to fill my eyes, again. I was too weak; I should fight them. The entire experience was humiliating.\n\n“We have named you Ciara that is why I am calling you that. You are on the planet Pateria. You are our sex slave.”\n\nI gasp looking up but he continued to speak.\n\n“You were brought from your home planet through a dimensional portal. They don’t open often on your world, so you can’t go back. If you are agreeable your life here will be pleasant. If you can’t be agreeable, well, we’ll be very sorry for that.”\n\nMaster Evan finished his speech by quickly wiping a tear off my cheek. I watched as he brought it to his lips.\n\n“Well?” the dark haired man on the bed asked looking at Master Evan.\n\n“Salt and something else,” he said.\n\nThe lanky man spoke then, “Ciara, what do you keep making with your eyes?” he asked curiously.\n\nI didn’t have a word for it in the language I was thinking in. “I’m sorry, Master,” I said getting flustered, “there is no word… Master.”\n\n“Was there a word in your first language?” the lanky man asked.\n\nI thought hard for a minute and tried to remember, it finally came to me. “Tear, Master,” I said triumphantly.\n\nMy face fell the minute I realized what an idiot I was being. In my confusion, Master Evan had wrapped his hand around my arm and was pulling me back to the bed.\n\nThe dark haired man looked at the lanky guy sharply as he spoke. “It is not to speak of its home planet again, Christof. Do not encourage that behavior,” he said.\n\nMaster Evan continued to tug me toward the bed and I resisted.\n\n“Please,” I cried with a wavering voice pulling against him, “don’t do this. Please don’t hurt me. I want to go home.”\n\nThe words sex slave kept rolling around in my head. I was not cut out to be anyone’s sex slave.\n\nMaster Evan pulled harder and I stumbled forward. The arm still ached from his prior abuse, so I didn’t fight too hard against him. Instead, I looked around the room for some other way out.\n\nMy frantic eyes locked on the bed and the two figures still lounging there. The dark haired man I had originally thought bought me was watching my display intently.\n\n“We have no wish to harm you,” he said. “We have paid a great deal for you and only wish to explore what we have bought.”\n\n‘They paid a lot? For me?’ I was so surprised that I stopped pulling against Master Evan for a moment.\n\nI saw a fifth figure moving into the room. He held a large brown jug in his hands.\n\n“We should give it water,” he said to the group. “It lost fluid at the auction has not taken any since.”\n\nHis hair was reddish brown and cut in short waves about his head. He was leaner than the others with a more finely muscled appearance. His waist had the same linen shift, though.\n\nAt the sound of something to drink I was suddenly parched. I licked my dry lips and watched him. He came to rest in front of me and dropped something on the ground.\n\n“Kneel Ciara and Kein will give you something to drink,” Master Evan commanded.\n\nI was so thirsty. Master Evan put his hands on my shoulders and encouraged me to comply. Slowly, I kneeled down and realized a thick, soft cushion was under my knees. I reached for the jug and was tutted.\n\nMaster Kein brought the jug to my lips and I took a tentative sip. It tasted like cool water with a hint of something sweet. I gulped as fast as he would allow me to drink. I didn’t finish until the jug was empty.\n\nWhen I was done drinking, Master Evan pulled me to stand again. He grabbed the arm he had twisted so viciously before and I didn’t fight as he pulled me to the bed. Pushing gently he forced me away from the edge, so I sat fully on the firm mattress.\n\nMaster Kein had set the jug down and moved beside the dark haired man. Master Evan slowly crawled until he was right beside me, facing me. I sat stiffly and upright watching the men surround me.\n\nMaster Evan sat very close next to me and looked into my eyes deeply. I flinched, but otherwise stayed still, when his hand came up to trace my the line of my nose.\n\n“Open your mouth, Ciara,” he commanded and I did.\n\nThe Dark haired man leaned forward until he and Master Evan were directly in my face.\n\nDark hair used his fingers to pull my lips back and he seemed to be examining my teeth. Using the flat of his finger he examined my entire mouth. Master Evan assisted him. It felt like he was pinching and playing with my tongue. They seemed satisfied with whatever they found.\n\nWhen the men removed their fingers I hesitantly closed my mouth. Master Evan touched my lips and I automatically opened them for him. He was no longer interested in the inside, though. The strange man sat and rubbed his fingers across my full lips.\n\n“So soft,” he said looking back at the dark haired man.\n\nJust like the rest of me my lips were curvy and thick. The color and texture seemed to mesmerize Master Evan. The attention was beginning to unnerve me again.\n\nThe dark haired man sat back and considered me. Master Evan stayed in my face and placed his fingers over the staccato pulse under my jaw.\n\n“Do not fear us, Ciara. We will not cause you harm. We will protect you,” he said.\n\nI wished I could believe that. Contrary to their words my arm still throbbed. It was a constant reminder what they could do if they cared to.\n\nDark hair laid a hand on my shoulder and I watched him warily. I jumped when Master Evan laid a hand on the opposite shoulder. They slowly started to stroke my arms on either side.",

It was in sharp contrast to being wrestled to the floor or dragged to the bed.\n\nThe Dark haired man made a disgruntled sound as he examined my right hand. I wanted to pull away, but his grip on my arm was firm. God, they were strong.\n\n“The skin is rough, cracked, and broken,” he said touching the lines on my palm.\n\n“As is this one,” Master Evan said from my other side.\n\n“It has not been well cared for, but that is of no concern now. We will use the cream on it,” Master Kein stated and the other men murmured approval.\n\nThe texture of me seemed to fascinate them. They ran their fingers along my arms and legs like they had never seen skin before. I could not stop the involuntary flinching.\n\nThe more they touched me, the more freaked out I got. They were overwhelming. I pulled at my limbs trying to curl myself into a ball.\n\n“Please let me go, please s",

I jumped when his warm hand lay over my heart.\n\n“No, it is afraid again,” he diagnosed correctly. “Do not fear Ciara, we will care for you now. Relax and allow us to prepare you for your purpose,” he commanded.\n\nWell, it didn’t sound like they wanted to eat me. I didn’t really understand what he meant by preparation, though. Once again, I forced myself to relax and calm down.\n\nPrior experience with my old boyfriend in the Chevy had taught me that tensing up before sex made it worse. If I wanted to survive this experience with my lower half intact, I would need to control myself. I concentrated on the ceiling and tried to relax.\n\nMaster Evan’s tongue had reached my torso now. I felt warm lips on my stomach and a tongue running over my flesh. He tasted my belly button thoroughly, he seemed to be checking it for something. He probed and pushed at it for seve",

Soon the burn and the stretch were bearable and not painful. They weren’t hurting me.\n\nI was flipped and pulled up to my knees. My arms crossed awkwardly in front of me and I felt something small, soft, and wet lapping against me back there.\n\n“Please no, Master, that’s dirty. Please, don’t do that,” I begged wiggling around.\n\nA tongue ran up my spine and to my hair line. I was sure it was Master Evan’s body that now covered mine.\n\n“No more protesting Ciara, it is unbecoming,” he whispered nipping my ear.\n\nFinding it had flavor he tasted my ear completely, pressing his tongue into my canal.

There are words you do not need to use.”\n\nHis pace quickened as he finished his statement. I glanced back and he looked ecstatic. Master Bane forced my head forward again.

I would not have fussed at all if they put me in this to walk downstairs.\n\nThe brown outfit they put me in was handed to them by a man at the large stone entrance. He placed their mark in the outfit, because it was theirs now. They would put it on me whenever I left the warriors’ compound, they told me.\n\nGetting into the outfit was complicated. The first thing they did was",

I wasn’t sure what to do, but Master Evan encouraged me to go with the other slave.\n\nWe went into a little room in the back. It was opulent. There seemed to be a sitting area around a little stage. The little brown bundle took off her robe quickly and revealed a very humanoid looking creature.\n\nShe had huge oval eyes in a dark face. Right away I noticed she was bald. The woman wore a collar like mine, as well as, wrist and ankle cuffs. She smiled broadly at me, but I was too stunned to speak as I took her in.\n\nHer clothing was all yellow gauzy fabric. Two strips passed over her shoulders and covered her breasts. On her waist hung an ornate golden chain, it held up a panel that covered the apex of her thighs and her buttocks. The same yellow gauze started at her waist and cascaded down her legs in strips that gathered at the ankles. Each time she took a step a beautiful dark leg",

No more than a couple of sips for most of them when they are new.”\n\n“It is like this from the root drink?” Master Kein asked incredulously. “We take it all the time…”\n\n“Yes, my friend, we are different you see. A bit of cocker dust will have it feeling much like itself in a moment. We sell it, by the way. Quite a few things are nice to have around when you are keeping a human.”\n\n“You’ll need to feed it now, though. The dust will make it uncomfortably hungry. Maybe you could come back and shop more later. I will have what you have ordered delivered, of course,” he mused and then called out, “Geoffrey, a sample of the cocker dust to Mia, please.”\n\nA moment later, Mia poured the nasty dust on my tongue.

        "content": "Beware… For happiness does not last for eternity. It comes, but when it goes, sadness descends with severity.\n\n***\n\nCeleste blew out a breath of adoration, eyes trained on the handsome boy standing with a tall masculinity on the podium.\n\nHis lips were drawn into a thin line, his expression as blank as a sheet of paper and yet his beauty outranked every werewolf standing on the meeting grounds; both men and women.\n\nCeleste wasn’t sure how he did it, but every single thing he did made her heart flutter and her legs weak. He was the center of her attention despite the many other people scattered around the vicinity.\n\nHis eyes…\n\nHis lips…\n\nHis body…\n\nEvery single aspect of him called out to her, but in what way could she respond?\n\nCertainly not by confessing that she had many times drooled while watching him and certainly not by hunting him a darn rabbit!\n\nBut either way she chose to respond, it was no secret that he was out of her league; for one, he was the future alpha of this pack and added to that ball of misfortune, was the fact that he was her sister’s boyfriend.\n\nTonight, twelve o’clock on the dot, would be the day they officially became mates.\n\nYou see, tomorrow was his birthday, the day he’d be able to scent his true mate and the celebration was on the brink of starting.\n\nThe yard was full of mated and unmated wolves and women from the Forester pack as well as other packs stood in deep anticipation, praying to the heavens that they’d be the one.\n\nCeleste stood in that deep anticipation too. Though her sister was ninety nine percent his mate, she couldn’t help but hope to be the remaining one percent.\n\nAt least then she’d have a teeny weeny chance to steal him from her b*tch of a sister.\n\nHer sister… It’s a hassle to even call her that. She didn’t act like a big sister much less a distant family member.\n\nAt school, Celeste was a victim to verbal abuse. The kids there always taunted her and instead of taking her side, her sister would always take theirs.\n\n‘Why is Celeste so ugly when Celia is sooo pretty?’\n\n‘Aren’t they supposed to be twins?’\n\n‘Why is one hot and the other is not?’\n\nIt was a struggle to go to school every day. She was the nobody, the odd one out and Celia was the one on top. She got everything she wanted, even mom and dad favored her, leaving Celeste with no one, absolutely no one to turn to.\n\nSad isn’t it? But Celeste was used to it by now.\n\nWith a sigh, she glanced at the woman next to her who kept whispering, “One minute left, one minute left, one minute left.”\n\nIt was annoying, but it made Celeste’s anticipation rise to a higher heights. In one minute, her world would turn upside down and she knew it.\n\nThe guy she had a crush on for years was about to fall in the hands of another. She didn’t want to see that happen, especially when her sister’s palm was stretched right open.\n\nSwallowing the lump that had formed in her throat, she took a shaky step back, eyes glancing at her lifelong crush one last time before turning her back.\n\nHer steps took her down the dark path of the pack lands, her hands buried in her pockets and her heart buried in sadness.\n\nIf not Zillon Macre, then who would be her mate?\n\nNobody else made her feel the way he did, he was like an angel to her. Everything about him was perfect, even when he was glaring or pouting.\n\nBut he wasn’t hers and she had to live with tha—\n\nWith a certain suddenness, a hand grabbed onto hers, squeezing her wrist in a vice grip.\n\nA frightened gasp left Celeste’s lips and without much thought, she turned to look at the perpetrator.\n\nIt was him, Zillon Macre, her angel.\n\nHis eyes were a blazing orange, signaling that his wolf had completely taken over and his blood red lips were drawn back in a sneer even as he pulled her against his thick and muscular chest.\n\n“Mine.” He grunted, arms encasing her in a very tight embrace. “Mate.”\n\nThose two words caused both Celeste’s heart and body to freeze.\n\nMine…?\n\nMate…?\n\nWhat was he talking about?\n\nDid he think she was Celia?\n\nIgnoring the denseness of her heart and the pleasurable sparks that seeped out of his touch, she pushed away from him. “Celia is somewhere in the dispersing crowd, I’m not yours, I’m not your mate.”\n\nZillon’s head tilted to the side, jaws clenching, grip tightening. “Mine…Mate…Mine!”\n\nHe pulled her back against him, nose latching onto the very crook of her neck where he proceeded to deeply inhale her scent. “Mark mate.”\n\nAnd without her consent, he did just that. His teeth had extracted and into the soft skin of her neck was where they intrusively sank.\n\nA cry of pain and pleasure had descended from her lips and like a dead man, she fell against his chest, lips ajar as she panted to catch her breath.\n\nShe tried to steady herself, but when the strong scent of the man who held her swept across her nose, her weak knees buckled and against his chest she fell again.\n\nShe was just 19, she wasn’t at the age to scent out her mate as yet, but now that she carried his mark…his scent was rather strong, comforting and arousing.\n\nLotus flowers and freshly chopped wood.\n\nIt calmed her heart and inside her head, her wolf consistently whispered, “Mate… mate… mate…”\n\nPride from her wolf filled her chest and amongst it was a flourishing happiness. After all, the moon goddess had granted her her wish.\n\nShe was mated to Zillon Macre, and on her neck was where his mark of eternity laid.\n\nNothing could tear them apart when this mark bonded them together, but only minutes later, she found that there was indeed something or rather someone who could tear them apart.\n\nNot her sister or her parents, but Zillon, her own mate…",

        "content": "Beware of this tricky thing called happiness, for it is the gateway to sadness.\n\n***\n\nThe world before Celeste’s eyes had turned upside down.\n\nHer life…\n\nHer choices…\n\nEverything had tilted to the left and Celeste was not grateful to the moon goddess for that.\n\nShe got her wish, but the odds weren’t at all in her favor.\n\nHer mate; Zillon Macre wasn’t as angelic as he seemed.\n\nHe was a beast, a man with no conscience, a man without a heart.\n\nHe treated her as if she was a toilet, but even so, her heart still beat for him.\n\nWhenever he was around, her lungs felt as light as a puff of cloud and his scent; its uniqueness as well as its sweetness calmed her diligently. The matebond was quite prominent between them, but for the two days that Celeste knew him as her mate, all he kept mentioning was her sister.\n\nHe didn’t see her as his mate, he made that very clear the night he marked her.\n\nThat night when the orange color in his eyes had dispersed to obsidian, he had shoved her away from him as if she was a contagious virus. He had regarded her with a glare and the words he had uttered later could’ve killed her on spot.\n\n‘Pitiful…you’re my mate? It’s a struggle to even look at you, how in heaven’s name would I live with you? That mark on your neck, forget about it, my wolf marked you, not me…my mark belongs to Celia.’\n\nCeleste’s heart had almost collapsed. It had been hard for her to breathe, more so when he had spat repulsively on the ground then continued to hurt her with his harsh words.\n\n‘The only reason I won’t reject you is because omegas die in the process and as future alpha protecting my pack is my main priority, not killing them. Move in in two days, I can’t have the pack members thinking that I’m in anyway a bad mate.’\n\nAnd then he had left Celeste on the pack grounds with a shattered heart. Her eyes had followed him until he was out of view and her wolf kept howling in her head.\n\nIt was painful; to be mated to someone who didn’t want you, but even after he shunned her with those words, she believed that the matebond would help him realize that the moon goddess did not make mistakes. If they were mated, then they must’ve been mated for a reason.\n\nWith a sad sigh, Celeste shoved her last piece of clothing in her suitcase. It was time to face him now, the two days which she had been so anxious through had passed and now it was time to move into Zillon’s house.\n\nShe wanted to go, dwelling close to her crush was a dream come through, but there was this doubt within her.\n\nWhat if he still proceeded to treat her bad?\n\nTo harshly remind her that she wasn’t who he really wanted?\n\nThat would break her; physically and mentally.\n\nIt would make her feel insufficient and unwanted.\n\nIt would make her feel even more lonely than she had been.\n\nAll her life, Celeste walked alone, her parents didn’t pay her much attention because they gave it all to Celia and at school, she had no friends.\n\nPreviously she had prayed for a mate, one she could freely talk to and one who’d…just always be there.\n\nZillon was number one on her list, but it seems he wasn’t capable of being the mate she always wanted.\n\nZipping her suitcase closed, she hauled it to the rectangular board hinged onto thick concrete. She twisted the knob situated on it and with a frustrated breath, she pulled the door open, not hesitating to step through.\n\nHer steps took her down the creaky, wooden stairs and as soon as she stepped down the last one, she was bombarded by her parents.\n\n“Celeste, are you sure you want to move in so soon?”\n\nCeleste looked over at her mom with nonchalant eyes. She sounded worried didn’t she?\n\nWell the factuality of it all was that she was only worried about Celia.\n\n“Yes mom, he told me to move in, remember?”\n\n“Yes but…b—” she cleared her throat and looked over at her mate; Williams. “Honey, tell her.”\n\nWilliams; Celeste’s father as well as the pack’s beta sighed. “Why is it that I’m the one who always explains?”\n\n“Because honey, you’re very good at speaking your mind, especially when it comes to things that normal people might find it hard to say.”\n\n“So I’m not normal?”\n\n“Not in the slightest bit, so tell her.”\n\nWith another sigh, the beta looked over at his daughter. “Look Celeste, we think this; you moving in with your mate won’t work. We believe it will only proceed to pull you and your sister apart. Zillon is your sister’s boyfriend and furthermore, your mate. It will be impossible to share.”\n\nCeleste squinted her eyes as she blankly stared at him. “Why would we have to share?” She shrugged. “He’s my mate, according to the pack’s tradition, it’s mandatory that he chooses me.”\n\n“But will he choose you?”\n\nThat question stabbed Celeste right in the heart and the feigned strength that had resided around her, quickly faded.\n\nWould he choose her?\n\nThey were mates, but he didn’t necessarily have to choose her. It’s rare but sometimes mates rejected each other.\n\nThe procedure was painful, so much so that omegas like celeste cannot live through it, but Celeste wouldn’t get rejected, would she?\n\nShe wouldn’t die all because she was unwanted by not just her mate but everyone, right?\n\nNothing of that sorts will happen to her…right?\n\nRight. Because Celeste wouldn’t let it. She’d give him her all and in the end, he wouldn’t have a choice but to choose her.\n\nNodding confidently to herself, she walked between her parents, hauling the suitcase behind her. “I’m not sure, I guess I’ll just have to move in to find out.”\n\n“Celest…”\n\nCeleste fanned her mother off and continued on her way, meeting the last resident in the house by the doorway, her big sister. She smiled faintly, the crook of her lips obviously fake. “I guess I’ll see you soon.”\n\n“You will be seeing me soon,” Celia replied. “When my Zillon kicks you out.”\n\nWith a lack of energy, of battle strength, “Yeah, well I guess you’re right Celia,” Celeste replied.\n\n“He should just reject you, at least then I’d get rid of my repetition.”\n\nA repetition? Celeste’s heartbeat quickened, her eyes darting over to the dull, white walls. “Is that what I was? It’s funny how I’m just finding out.” She chuckled, fingers clenching tight around the handle of her suitcase. “You should’ve told me sooner.”\n\n“I should’ve, I don’t know what stopped me from making it known how unwanted you are. You’re just an extra to mom and dad, and someone easily replaceable by their own mate. But go now, you’ll find out on your journey, how insignificant you can be.”\n\nCeleste’s eyes almost watered as she made her way outside. She knew her sister was right, no matter how she tried to deny it, she really was insignificant.\n\nNobody wanted her… But it was okay…as long as she wanted herself.",

        "content": "Beware… They’re like two face coins. Not because they smile they’re on your side.\n\n***\n\nCeleste stepped shakily up the stairs. She had long passed her boundaries, and now she resided on Zillon’s; on his land, on his porch.\n\nShe couldn’t deny the nervousness that ran through her, she could feel as her heart pumped heavily in her chest, she could even hear it; the quick and dense beats that sounded like fast fleeting footsteps.\n\nIn deep anxiety, her eyes drifted to the door that stood tall in front of her. Should she knock?\n\nShe should, shouldn’t she? But she couldn’t.\n\nHis scent was as strong as it had been the night he had marked her. The potent scent of lotus flowers and chopped woods. It was maddening, it invoked in her a sense of need; one that had her craving him, his arms that provided security, and his lips that ‘should’ be able to provide her with words of encouragement, especially after what she withstood on her way here.\n\nHer sister’s words had grown like a vine within her head, though her neck had already been claimed by Zillon, Celeste couldn’t help but fear the act of him putting her sister above her…after all, she had claimed his mark, but Celia had claimed his heart.\n\nThat’s one of the reasons why she couldn’t bring herself to knock on the door. Zillon would probably remind her again that him marking her was a mistake, he’d probably even tell her that her sister was who he craved, who he’d eventually mate…and that would tear Celeste right open.\n\nTaking a shaky step back, Celeste’s eyes darted down to her feet or rather to the old sneakers that covered them. A mate, how she had longed to have one, but sadly, her mate wasn’t wholly hers.\n\nTears, the ones she had been holding back pricked her eyes, even more so when his scent got stronger, engulfing her in its warmth. Approaching footsteps from beyond the door greeted her sensitive ears and in panic, she took another step back.\n\nHe had probably caught a whiff of her scent, he had probably heard her anxious steps, he had probabl—\n\nCeleste’s heart jumped when the door was pulled open, and in front of her, her crush, her mate, her everything stood.\n\nHis eyes travelled up her legs until they stared straight into hers, and somehow the eye contact had her legs threatening to leave her unsteady.\n\nIt was the matebond she knew, she could feel the pull, an invisible string that kept forcing her to move closer, but with all her heart, she ignored it and wiped at her teary eyes. “I-I came.” She shakily smiled.\n\nZillon nodded, eyes summing her up with malice. “Right, come on in.”\n\nHe opened up the door wider, stepping aside so she could pass by him. “Your room is the one furthest away from mine. Everything about you is filthy, your scent makes my mouth taste bitter, please stay out of my way. Don’t talk to me, don’t look at me, just stay in your room.” He closed the door the moment her suitcase breached inside. “You may eat, there’s food in the fridge and on Fridays, I will hunt you meat as your mate, but you are nothing beyond that; a mate that is unwanted.”\n\nCeleste’s heart tore into two, no three, or perhaps it was now shattered into many pieces. His words were as sharp as a knife, cutting their way into her chest.\n\nHer wolf howled like a wounded dog in her head, and pain scourged her as if she had been whipped. “I-I…”\n\nTears fell down her cheeks, her knees weak enough for her to have to hold onto the walls to keep steady. “I…I’m sorry…”\n\nZillon glared at her. “For what?”\n\n“For…for not being enough.”\n\n“You don’t have to apologize, it’s not your fault, it’s the moon goddess’s for even thinking of making you.”\n\nWith that, he trudged past her, hands in his pockets. “And let me be more specific.” He stopped by the corner. “Your room is the last room on the right upstairs, mine is the first one, come nowhere near it.”\n\nAnd then he disappeared.\n\nCeleste collapsed against the wall, hand clenched against her chest. The mate bond was still strong, but the pain was stronger. It ran through her body as if it was the blood in her veins. It felt like fire, burning incessantly, but she’d pull through, for Zillon, she could do anything.\n\nShe’d show him, she’d make sure he sees her efforts, she’d display just how strong her love for him was, how abundant. Surely it would change the way he thought of her, it would undoubtedly make him feel the same.\n\nEasing up from the wall, she wiped her eyes once more and stumbled further into the house. Zillon’s scent was embedded inside, it was so strong that it felt as though it was clogging her nostrils. It was supposed to be a sign of reassurance, he was her mate after all, but all she felt was nervousness and the lingering pain in her chest.\n\nBut it would subside, and one day not far away, she’d feel safe in a room that only withheld his aroma.\n\nStepping around the corner, her eyes wandered around what she knew was the living room. It consisted of couches, a glass table, a television, and thick mats were sprawled out on the floor.\n\nLooking away from them, her eyes greeted the stairs, traveling up to the room Zillon resided in. She could hear him, his steps, his unsteady breaths…she could feel him too, the matebond made that more than just possible, but despite the fact that it was pulling her towards him, she walked past his room and to the one he had directed her to.\n\nIn there, she unpacked her stuff in the empty closet she found, and then she laid rather tiredly on the bed inside.\n\nShe’d wait, one day he would come to want her, and it’d would be the happiest day of her life. It’d make up for the pain in her chest, for the disrespectful words he told her, and for the harsh way he looked at her…\n\nAnd that day, her Zillon would be happy too.",

        "content": "Celeste shuffled off of the mattress when she became tired of the hungry howls of her stomach. Night had already dusk and she hadn’t eaten anything since she woke up this morning.\n\nHer throat was dry, her body empty, even her wolf felt weak, but even still, she was scared of stepping foot down those stairs just so Zillon could degrade her again. She knew that she’d eventually have to, especially if she wanted him to get use to her, to come to love her, but she feare—\n\nCeleste shook her head. She couldn’t fear the words of her own mate or the look in his eyes. She had to withstand it, she had to see past it with a flourishing smile.\n\nShe was hungry, she’d go down and cook for herself, and cook him something as well. She hadn’t heard his room door open since it closed. He was perhaps asleep, but even still, he must be hungry too.\n\nTaking a step forward, Celeste sighed. She had to be braver, he was hers, she was his. Despite all the things he said to her, they were mated, she had to take care of him, even if he didn’t take care of her. So she’d cook him her best, she’d wish him well, she’d love him, just until he learned to love her.\n\nGarnering all the courage she could, she finally stepped out of her room and walked down the hall.\n\nAs she walked, his scent got stronger, encompassing her with the warmth it brought with it. She could hear every breath of air that left his lips as she passed his room, she could even hear as he tapped his desk, his dresser, his table, or anything with a hard surface that resided in his room.\n\nHe wasn’t asleep, she knew that now, and that fact made her heart pump a little faster. She didn’t stop walking though, instead, her steps took her down the stairs and her sensitive sense of smell brought her to the kitchen.\n\nThere, she did what she had promised to, she cooked up some meat, some spaghetti, and some rice, just in case he had a big appetite. And when she was done, she shared herself a plate, and shared him one as well.\n\nHers was placed on the table, while his was placed on a tray along with a cup of water and his eating utensils. He told her not to go near his room, but she had to be brave, didn’t she?\n\nWalking out of the kitchen, she walked her way back up the stairs and stood nervously in front of his room.\n\nShe could hear her heart beat even louder than the constant shuffling on the inside. He could probably hear it too, but putting that aside, she shakily reached forward, knocking only once.\n\nEvery footstep he took forward frightened her, but she held her ground, despite how shaky the tray in her hand seemed. The door opened, and slowly, shyly Celeste looked up into the eyes of her mate.\n\nHe was glaring at her again, this time even deeper than the first. “What are you doing here Celes-Cele—?”\n\n“C-Celeste… That’s-that’s my name.”\n\n“I didn’t ask for your name, what the f*ck are you doing here? I told you to not come here, and yet you had the audacity to knock. What do you want?”\n\n“I-I was hungry, so I cooked. I thought you’d be hungry too, so I brought y—”\n\nThe tray was shoved straight out of Celeste’s hand and onto the floor. She looked down at it, dirty and scattered, then back at him. “Why d—”\n\n“Feed that to the dogs. I’m not hungry, and even if I was, I want nothing from the likes of you. It probably tastes as filthy as you smell. Leave me alone, don’t try to sway me with food, I do not want you.”\n\nTears filled Celeste’s eyes, and pain scourged her heart. Why did he have to remind her of that fact every time he spoke? Why did he have to hurt her, her wolf, why did he…?\n\nTurning away from him, Celeste held onto her chest as if that would cease the relentless pain on the inside. “Th-there’s more in the kitchen if you change your mind. I’ll clean this up, and I’m sorry, t-this time, it’s for bothering you.”\n\n“I will not change my mind, not about the food, and not about you. You should be ashamed, I’m your sister’s boyfriend, and yet you’re trying to sneak your way into my room with food.”\n\nCeleste didn’t respond, his words were painful enough, answering him would only encourage him to say more. So she instead staggered her way back down stairs in search of a broom.\n\nIt took her a while, but at least she found one, and with it, she cleaned up his floor, then made her way straight through his front door.\n\nShe wasn’t in the mood to eat anymore, she wasn’t in the mood to do a thing but cry. He didn’t have to be so harsh, he didn’t have to treat her that bad. She was just trying to be nice, trying to be a good mate, and yet, he took it the wrong way.\n\nStooping on his porch, she called forth the wild part of her, the inner beast that was even weaker than her. An omega, a wolf too weak to withstand physical pain and emotional ones.\n\nOne by one, her bones cracked as she transformed. Hair grew from her pores, her arms turned into feet, her clothes turned into shreds and her face turned into that of a wolf.\n\nFully sheathed by the skin of her beast, she ran off into the woods beside his house, determined to forget the words he told her, and the look that had been in his eyes, but could she ever forget being unwanted?\n\n***\n\nCeleste skated breathlessly into Zillon’s front yard, still wearing the clothing of her wolf’s skin. The night had gotten darker, the sun had gone down, and though she had run to her heart’s full content, she still felt like she hadn’t done enough.\n\nZillon’s words were still engraved in her head. They for one made it hard for her to cut her run short, but sadly, she had to, not because of the matebond, but because of what the elders had once taught her and the other young she-wolves of the pack.\n\nNo matter what, a newly mated female should return to their mate before 7:00pm. It is said that werewolves were very possessive of their mates, especially the high-ranking ones. The elders didn’t go in depth as to ‘why’ as well as ‘what’ would happen, but she didn’t really want to know, because nothing would happen, especially if it concerned her mate.\n\nHe had said it before, he wanted nothing to do with her, so why would he act out or become possessive when she neglects to come in on time?\n\nRight, he wouldn’t.",

        "content": "Taking in a deep breath, Celeste crouched in front of the porch, starting the transition from wolf to human.\n\nHer ears were the first thing that withdrew, and then the hair that had covered her skin. Soon, she stood naked in the darkness that surrounded her.\n\nThe wind she had previously enjoyed in her wolf form now licked at her skin with a newfound potency, cruelly urging her to head inside. The moon above shone bright, lighting her path as she stepped up to the stairs that led to the door.\n\nShe only made it up the first one before the door in front of her swung open, revealing Zillon. Just like the night he had marked her, his eyes were a bright orange, staring straight into her soul. He exhaled, the fog it formed making his breath almost visible. “Where were you?”\n\nHis voice was deep… heavily raspy, making the thought that his wolf was in control a fact and not just an assumption. “I-I…I went out for a run.” She responded to him.\n\n“Come here.” His words were drawled in a command, leaving Celeste no option but to obey.\n\nHer movements were slow and reluctant, but she didn’t stop until she stood in front of him. Being naked was a usual thing for werewolves, so despite being nervous, despite being self-conscious, she held her ground and shyly peeked up at the beast she was mated to. “I…what do y—?”\n\n“Shhh…”\n\nCeleste’s lips smacked shut immediately, quietly watching as he leaned in, resting his head against her neck. He inhaled, taking in her scent. “Lavender and freshly picked mint leaves, only tainted by the scent of the forest…nothing else or rather, nobody else.”\n\nHis arms wrapped around her naked body, pulling her against his chest. “Mine…” His deep voice chanted. “I can’t wait until you’re in heat. I’ll wholly claim you, take you, mark you, love you…”\n\nA fire Celeste did not summon rose between her legs as she listened to his words. Hearing him say she was his, feeling his touch against her skin…she felt as though she was living in bliss.\n\nHis hands were cold and yet they brought her warmth, so soft, so gentle, making the matebond, the once distinct pull now stronger.\n\nIt was magnetic between them, the connection was so intense that Celeste’s legs shook when his hands caressed the small of her back, then slowly slid down to grab the bare globes of her ass.\n\nShe moaned almost breathlessly against him, burying her head against his chest as pleasure scourged her. “I…please…”\n\nShe wasn’t even sure what she was begging for, but she wanted something. Him maybe, just him…\n\nZillon, or rather his wolf smirked, cruelly letting her loose. “It’s not time yet my love, on the day of your heat which is not far from now, I’ll take you, I’ll give you what you want.”\n\nHe stepped back, robbing her of the safety she felt in his arms. “Your scent calms me, your presence as well, please do not leave without my permission.”\n\n“But I…”\n\nThe orange color in his eyes slowly dulled to obsidian, and the calmness that had laid across his face turned to one of anger. “Oh god no…”\n\nCeleste embraced herself, now feeling the urge to hide what little she could from him. This wasn’t the side of him that had marked and promised to claim her, this was the Zillon who wholly hated her. “I-I’m sorry…”\n\n“And let me guess, this time you’re sorry for acting like a whore?”\n\n“I…” Celeste shook her head. “I’m just…”\n\n“Go inside and get some clothes. Stop sicking my stomach with your presence, or moreover your nakedness.” He stepped aside, leaving the doorway open. “My wolf was in control just now, I’m sure you knew. This was yet again a mistake, one that I regret making.”\n\nCeleste stepped past him with another hole in her heart. Her chest felt heavy again, her eyes got teary, she felt pathetic.\n\nWas she a mistake too, one that even her parents regretted. Celia was born a beta and even as her twin, Celeste was born an omega. It wasn’t fair, the moon goddess kept cheating her, she kept giving Celia everything she wanted.\n\nThe blood of a beta…\n\nThe love of her parents…\n\nThe popularity…\n\nAnd even her own god damn mate…\n\nWhat else would Celia steal?\n\nHer life?\n\nTears pooled down her cheeks as she trotted up the stairs feeling just as dejected as she felt when she had left.\n\nIf only she was prettier, sexier, higher ranked…maybe then, Zillon would see her as his mate. But was there any way to attain the beauty and the power?\n\nWas there any way to attain his love?\n\nPerhaps not, but how would she know without trying?\n\nIt has just been a day, surely she couldn’t achieve such in this short span of time. Tomorrow she’d try harder, and the next day, she’d try her best too.\n\nShe wouldn’t let Celia steal from her anymore, Zillon was hers.\n\n***\n\nCeleste woke up in the middle of the night, awfully hungry after not eating anything at all in the day. The food she had cooked earlier on was probably still in the kitchen, and after heating it up, it would have to cease the growls of her empty stomach.\n\nShuffling off of the bed, she stepped onto the floor, and out the door. Slow and cautious, that’s how she walked, not wanting to wake Zillon up if there was a possibility that he was asleep.\n\nHer steps took her down the stairs, and though she tried her best to be quiet, each spirally positioned board squeaked as she walked down them.\n\nShe sighed in relief when she tiptoed down the last one, and straight to the kitchen was where she headed.\n\nShe could practically hear the night on the outside… The crickets, and the dead silence that lingered behind it. Not even a footstep tainted it, however, she could hear movements in the kitchen. It was probably a rat, but even so, she stayed alert as she shoved the door open.\n\nHer eyes sauntered inside immediately, spotting the person she least expected to see in her pot…Zillon.",

Every time she got hurt, she had to come here to get the wound patched up and it wasn’t any different now.\n\nSighing, she took a left turn, spotting the door at the edge of the hall. She",

        "content": "Sophie's POV\n\n\"So, what makes you think that we'd actually accept you as a part-time teacher here at our university?\" asked one of the interviewers.\n\nWith my hands shaking, I took a deep breath and faced her confidently. At least, that's the definition of confidence for me. Then I opened my mouth, \"I am actually...err... I've been a straight-A student from kindergarten up until now. And I am also running for the highest rank in our class now. I really like children, and I love teaching them...\"\n\nYou can do it, Sophie. No need to be nervous. You can do it, girl.\n\nThe woman and the man beside her looked at each other and nodded, \"So, Laurens is your surname? Do you have any relationship with Mr. Albert Laurens?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is my father.\"\n\nBoth of their eyes widened upon hearing what I just said. They quickly stood up and bowed their heads at me, \"G-Good morning, Miss Laurens.\"\n\n\"N-No, you don't have to be so polite to me. I'm just an applicant here, and so I just want to know if I get in,\" I asked them, my fingers crossed and my heart beating so loud that it could actually jump off my chest right now.\n\n\"Of course, Miss Laurens! You are in! You can now teach in our school whenever you want to start!\"\n\n\"R-Really?! Oh, thank you so much, you don't know how much this means to me, thank you so much!\"\n\n\"Y-You're welcome, Miss Laurens. It's also an honor for us to have you here in our institution.\"\n\nI was jumping enthusiastically as soon as I stepped out of that room. Teaching children has been my dream ever since I was a child. It was my mom's dream for me, too, before she died. And now it came true! I'm sure she's so happy for me. Although I think the only reason I got in was because of my surname, Laurens.\n\nMy father, Albert Laurens, is known to be one of the richest men here in New York City. But that doesn't mean I am rich too. Everything that he has they don't really belong to me. I'm just his daughter with one of their maids before, to whom he had a one-night stand even though he already has his wife.\n\nAfraid that Dad's parents would get mad and shoo him away from their family, Mom decided just to leave their mansion and escape to hide me from them. She lived in a place where she thought everyone wouldn't be able to find her but she was wrong because my grandparents are so rich that they can hire anyone just to locate where she is.\n\nThey took me away from my mother. I escaped their house when I was ten years old and went back to my mother, but they took me back again. Mom also told me to just stay at my father's house, too. Then, one day, she had a heart attack and died. I went to her burial alone.\n\nUntil then, I lived at my father's house. Their enormous mansion could actually have a hundred families to live in. If you're thinking that I live a wealthy and happy life since I'm a Laurens, then you are all wrong. They don't treat me as one of them anyway. I do all the things that maids do: I serve them, wash their clothes, bring their clothes, carry their bags, water the plants, wipe the windows, floors, and anything. That's the consequence of living inside their house.\n\n\"Hey, Sophie, where the hell did you go again?\" Samantha asked me as soon as I stepped inside the mansion.\n\n\"I applied for a job,\" I simply replied.\n\nSamantha is the oldest daughter of my father and his wife, his first and legal wife. They have two daughters and one son in total, who are, of course, way older than me.\n\n\"A job? Why? Do you still need money even if Dad's already giving you a monthly allowance?\"\n\n\"It's not about the money, I really want to teach children ever since.\"\n\nShe just rolled her eyes, \"Oh whatever, do what you want, just don't forget to do my assignments. Tomorrow will be the deadline for all of that.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Hey, Sophie!\" There goes Sera, the second to the oldest daughter of my father. \"Buy all of these, okay? I need that in my school tomorrow, and also, don't forget to go to Harold's house and tell him that I'm already breaking up with him.\"\n\nMy eyes widened as I looked at her with confusion, \"Why don't you just break up with him in person?\"\n\n\"Shut up! Just tell him! I don't want to waste my time with his drama again!\"\n\nSera has the habit of dating different boys in her school and then breaking up with them after a week. But what's worse is that I am the one who talks to his boyfriend and tells them that she wants a break-up. I always have to make up stories and find possible reasons why she wants a break-up. I just suppressed a sigh then I was about to go to my room and change my clothes when I suddenly saw Sebastian walking towards me with a smile on his face.\n\n\"Seb!\"\n\n\"Sophie! You need to hear this new song that I composed!\" he said enthusiastically. Seb is two years older than me and really loves music. Out of all the siblings I have, he's the one I'm closest to. \"Alright, I will just change my clothes, and then we'll listen to it later, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay! I'll wait for you at my studio.\"\n\n\"Okay!\" Then I finally opened the door to my room and went inside with a smile on my face.",

        "content": "Author's POV\n\n\"Boss, please spare me; give me more time, please!\" A man who looked about the age of thirty was kneeling in front of a tall young man wearing a black suit and tie, holding a gun in his right hand, playing with it while looking at him. They were surrounded by many men in black suits, too, smiling and glaring at each other.\n\nThe room was a torture cell; different weapons and stains of blood were evident on the floor and the wall. There was blood on the side of the lips of the poor man. His eyes seemed to be punched so many times that they made a violet circle around them.\n\n\"Boss, I will pay you next week, I swear. If I don't, then you can kill me!\"\n\n\"Renzo, I already gave you one month to pay me, and now, you're asking for another week?\"\n\n\"Boss, please... please forgive me...\" he was already crying. The tears in his eyes and the blood all over his face were already mixing.\n\nThen the man rose from his chair, standing before the poor guy, \"You know how I fucking hate liars, Renzo. I fucking hate it whenever someone tries to fool me, and you know what I do to them?\" his thick black brows rose and his grey eyes turned dark as he pointed the gun to the man's head.\n\n\"Boss...don't do this...don't...\"\n\n\"Say hi to the devil for me, Renzo.\"\n\nBaam.\n\nThe sound of the gun reverberated through the whole cell as blood came dripping on the floor. Vincent tossed the gun to the floor as he began walking towards one of his men and wiped his hands with a white hand towel.\n\n\"Throw him somewhere, then give money to his family. Clean this mess. This cell smells fuck now.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\nThen, he finally walked towards the exit with the other men following him. He had no expression on his face; his eyes were cold, and his strong and tall frame made him look like a total mafia boss that everyone was afraid of. He had curly black hair, a pointed nose, high cheekbones, and a prominent lower jaw and chin.\n\n\"Where are we heading now?\" he asked his men.\n\n\"To Mr. Laurens, sir. The CEO of Laurencio Holdings.\"\n\n\"That old man who pleaded for me to help him with his business?\" Vincent asked, lighting up the cigarette that Joe handed him, his assistant. \"He wouldn't be where he is today if I didn't help him.\"\n\n\"He still owes you $900 billion, sir. I've heard that he is also planning to make an alliance with Mr. Romano.\"\n\nVincent almost laughed when he heard that. \"Romano's in my pocket. Is he thinking that he could really start a war against me by running into people who have big debts to me, too? Dickhead.\"\n\nHis men laughed as they opened the door of a black limousine for him.\n\n\"Let's test his bravery. I'm going to play with that old hag.\"\n\n***\n\nMr. Laurens was relaxing in his swivel chair after a meeting with a well-known mafia boss in town named Pablo. He talked to him and asked for an alliance against Vincent, but the man said that he couldn't do that since Vincent is his boss too.\n\n\"Damn you, Hastings. Gathering all the people and making them your men. You're a real asshole. I won't let you have your hands around my neck this time.\"\n\nThen the door went open. Just as he was about to stand up and turn his head to see who just arrived, someone pushed him down, his face on the tiled ceramic floor.\n\n\"W-Who the hell--\"\n\n\"Long time no see, Laurens.\"\n\nUpon hearing that cold, deep voice, Mr. Laurens already knew who it was. \"V-Vincent Hastings?\"\n\n\"Oh, so you still remember me, huh?\"\n\n\"W-What are you doing here? What do you need from me?\"\n\nVincent laughed like a devil, then he walked towards Mr. Laurens and grabbed him by the head, effortlessly lifting him with one arm.\n\n\"What do I need from you? Are you even serious? Are you sure you don't know why the hell I am here?\"\n\n\"I-If it's about the debt that I owe you, I-I don't have that amount of money yet... I can only pay you $900 million for now...\"\n\n\"$900 million? What do you want me to do with that? Buy candy?\"\n\n\"V-Vincent, I will pay you next month, I promise you, I will pay you next month...\" he pleaded, trying to take Vincent's hands off his collar, almost choking him. \"Please, spare me...\"\n\nVincent clenched his jaw as he pushed him on the wall, so hard that Mr. Hastings groaned with pain. \"How many times did I hear that line today? All of the people that I talked to pleaded to me too, and do you know what happened to them?\"\n\n\"N-No, no Vincent please, I will definitely pay you, I can even do whatever you want me to do...\"\n\n\"By the way, I've heard that you tried to talk to Romano and Pablo, is that true?\"\n\nMr. Laurens' eyes widened, \"W-Who told that to you? I-I didn't--\"\n\nVincent suddenly punched the wall next to his face, he closed his eyes with his trembling body. \"You know what pisses me off the most aside from liars?\" He let go of him and took a step back, putting his hand inside his pocket, \"Traitors. I really hate it when someone's trying to make a move behind my back especially when I helped them climb the stairs up to where they are right now. You should try being grateful, Laurens.\" Then he took a gun and pointed it to Mr. Laurens, whose eyes are now widened, looking at Vincent.\n\n\"Vincent... N-No, this company still needs me... my people still need me... my family needs me...\"\n\n\"And satan said that he needs you now too.\"\n\n\"N-No, Vincent... I could give you everything... I can be your servant... I will give you everything, just not this company...\"\n\n\"Aside from this company, what else do you have?\" Vincent asked, playing with the trigger of the gun, still pointed at the poor man.\n\n\"I-I have 200 yachts, 300 mansions, cruises, I-I have three daughters! You can marry one of them if you want!\"\n\nVincent laughed, \"You are offering your own daughter to me? Is that how desperate you are?\"\n\n\"J-Just don't kill me...\"\n\nVincent thought for a while before opening his mouth again, \"Are your daughters beautiful? Or do they look like you, too?\"\n\nHis men laughed from behind him. \"T-The youngest is the most beautiful among them...\"\n\n\"And you will give her to me?\"\n\n\"Y-Yes...\"\n\n\"Okay, show her to me tomorrow. No, bring all of your daughters to me. Bring them to me tomorrow night. If you don't do what you promised, I won't hesitate to kill you this time.\"",

She's a beautiful woman in her 20s, our professor in literature, my favorite subject. I quickly nodded as I clutched my books to my chest.\n\n\"Yes, Miss.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nMr. Jacobs was our school doctor here in our University. He's handsome with his blonde hair slicked back, his deep emerald eyes that could melt someone who dares to stare at him. He also has the body of a Greek God which makes all of the girls here drool over him. And if you ask me if I like him, is it so obvious?\n\nI first met him during my first day here in this University. He approached me because I got lost and didn't know where my building was. Then he told me where and even accompanied me until I finally found it. I thought he was my classmate too because he looks too young. That's why I was surprised when I found out that he works as the official University doctor here.\n\nMy heart started beating so loud when I saw Mr. Jacobs sitting on his usual swivel chair writing something on paper. He was wearing an eyeglass that he used to wear which made him look intelligent and attractive to me. How can he sit there, just write and look incredibly handsome? I wonder if he already has a girlfriend, I wish he's single.\n\n\"Err... Doctor Kristan...\"\n\nHe stopped writing and looked in my direction, a smile immediately appeared on his face as soon as he saw me. \"Sophie!\"\n\n\"G-Good morning, Doctor Kristan.\" I smiled sweetly, a smile that I will never show to anyone but him.\n\nHe stood up and walked towards me, his smile didn't vanish. \"How are you feeling? Is there something I can help you with?\"\n\nOh God, there goes the most handsome man I have ever seen in my life. Can I just tell him that I'm not feeling well because my heart seems like it's about to jump off my chest right now?\n\n\"N-No, doctor. Miss Perry wants to see you at her office.\"\n\n\"Oh, well thank you for going here. I will go there immediately.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jacobs. I will be going now.\" I said, averting my gaze from his.\n\nHe then patted my head and smiled, \"Thanks, Sophie.\"\n\nI was touched by an angel! What an honor!\n\n\"You're welcome Mr. Jacobs... hehehe... s-see you tomorrow...\"\n\n\"See you, Sophie.\"\n\nThen I finally started walking towards the door, still waving at him. I could just literally sit there and watch him breathe for all my life. Did that sound creepy?\n\nI heaved a deep sigh when I closed the door, a smile still on my face. Oh, Mr. Jacobs, can you just be mine?\n\nIf only I could have him, but that's impossible. I'm just a student, I don't have anything to boast about except for my grades. But I promised to myself that one day, when I finally have my own job and I finally have enough money, I will go back here and confess to him. I hope I have a chance.\n\n\"Teacher Sophiee!!!\" Laila, one of my students came running to me as soon as she saw me enter the kindergarten. She's always excited to see me, that's why I'm always excited to go here and see her too, I really love kids.\n\n\"Laila!!!\"\n\nJust when she was about to run towards me, a man suddenly walked past her, and so she fell onto the ground after bumping on the man's legs.\n\n\"Leila!\" I quickly ran towards Leila to see if she was okay, \"Leila, I'm so sorry, are you alright?\"\n\n\"Teacher... S-Sophiee.... waaaaa....\" She then began crying.\n\n\"Ssssh... stop crying Leila, it's alright. Don't cry now, I will buy you an ice cream, okay?\" I guided her to a nearby bench and had her sit there as I glanced at the man to whom she bumped.\n\nHe was just casually walking with his hands in his pocket as if nothing happened. What a rude man he is, not even apologizing to a kid?! Is he even a human?!\n\nWith my blood boiling and my fist shaking with anger, I walked towards that man and grabbed him by his arm to stop him from walking, \"H-Hey, Mister!\"\n\nHe stopped walking when he heard my voice, he looked at my hand that was holding his arm and finally faced me. My eyes automatically widened as soon as I saw his face and realized how tall he was that he's already towering over me. His cold gray eyes stared intently at me, I can't even see any emotion on his face, i-is he a robot?\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" he asked, then I realized that I was still holding his arm and so I immediately let go of it and stared back at him as I gulped.\n\nWhat is happening to me? Why does his aura feel intimidating? He's definitely not ugly because HE IS SO HANDSOME as hell but I don't know why he looks fearful even though I don't really know him yet.\n\n\"L-Leila... the kid who bumped on to you a while ago...\"\n\n\"What about her?\" his brows are now furrowed as if he's turning impatient.\n\n\"Why didn't you stop and ask her if she's okay? She's a kid, you should've at least said sorry.\"\n\nHe looked at me as if I was crazy then a smirk appeared on his face, \"Hey woman, do you even know who you're talking to right now?\"",

        "content": "Sophie's POV\n\n“I-I don’t care who you are but all I know is that you can’t just leave a kid crying after hurting her.” I said while maintaining eye-to-eye contact with the Greek god standing before me with his expressionless face. He looks only as young as me but why is he so tall?\n\nHis right brow raised as he looked at me, “So you don’t really know me?”\n\n“I don’t know you, okay? Do I even have to know who you are?”\n\nI don’t even know where I get that bravery. I just stared at him although my hands were already shaking. His eyes were sharp and I think I could already die with his glare.\n\n“You’re quite brave, huh? Well, let’s see where your bravery would take you.”\n\nWithout any warning, the man grabbed me by the waist and pressed his lips on mine. My eyes widened and I froze in place. I placed my hands on his chest to push him off but he was so strong that it became useless.\n\nHe forcefully parted my lips with his tongue and I just found myself closing my eyes as if I was enjoying it. When he finally let go of me, that’s when I realized what just happened. I raised my hand and slapped him on his right cheek.\n\n“Y-You bastard! W-Why did you do that?!”\n\n“Thanks for the dessert, see you around some other time.” He said as he turned around and started walking away. I badly wanted to stop him and punch him in the face but my feet just won’t cooperate. I was just looking at him with my mouth open until he finally stepped inside a black limousine together with his men laughing.\n\nI balled my hand into a fist as I yelled at the top of my lungs, “YOU PERVERTED ASSHOLE!!”\n\n“Teacher Sophie!” I only stopped cursing that man in my head when Laila suddenly approached me. I knelt down and carried her in my arms.\n\n“I-I’m sorry, Laila. Are you alright?”\n\nShe shook her head. “I’m fine, Teacher Sophie.”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“Yes. That man, the man kissed you a while ago. Is he your boyfriend, teacher Sophie?” Laila innocently asked without even knowing how her question automatically made my face blush.\n\nI wasn’t able to answer quickly. “L-Laila, let’s just go inside already okay? For sure your other classmates are already waiting for us.” I changed the topic.\n\n“Okay…” my ever-obedient student replied.\n\nI wasn’t able to focus on what I was teaching the whole time because of what happened. Good thing my students didn’t notice that. I rode the bus going home and went straight to my room as soon as I arrived. I lay down on my bed and closed my eyes. Erase that incident in your mind, Sophie. Just pretend that it didn’t happen, okay?\n\nThen I snapped my eyes open. “Did I just… did I just let a stranger kiss me?”\n\nI let a stranger kiss me?!!! How dare him do that to me?!\n\nThat was my first kiss… the kiss that I wanted to experience with Mr. Jacobs… Now it’s gone… I already gave my first kiss to a stranger.\n\nI lay down on my bed and hugged one of my pillows as tears began running down my face. “My first kiss… that bastard…”\n\n“Sophie? Are you already there?”\n\nI suddenly heard dad’s voice coming from outside of my room. I hurriedly sat up and wiped my tears away before walking towards my door and opened it.\n\n“D-Dad?”\n\n“I’m so glad you’re already here, Sophie. Can we talk for a while?” dad asked.\n\n“Sure dad, have a seat please.” I said as I pulled a chair for him. I sat on the couch and looked at him. “What is it, dad?”\n\nDad straightened his back before looking at me, “Sophie, there’s actually something that I want you to know. Wait, did you cry?”\n\n“H-Huh? N-No, I didn’t. My eyes just look like this whenever I-I feel sleepy… Anyway, what is it that you want to tell me?”\n\nHe heaved a sigh then he looked at me, he seemed to be hesitating for what he was going to say. “Sophie, listen very carefully. I-I think it’s already time for you to get married.”\n\n“W-What? Get married?”\n\n“I know how hard it is for you to stay in this house, Sophie. Your step siblings treat you like a servant, don’t you get tired with that? Don’t you sometimes wish you could just leave here and be free? I mean, I just want you to be happy, Sophie.”\n\n“Dad, I’m still seventeen and I am still studying. I don’t have any intentions of getting married to someone and I—I don’t even have a boyfriend.”\n\n“I can suggest a man.” He suddenly said which made me look at him.\n\nI furrowed my brows, “D-Dad? You’re really planning to have me get married already? But I don’t want to get married with anyone yet, daddy. I want to finish my studies first, I want to fulfill my dreams, I want to make you proud, a-and I want to marry the man that I really love.”\n\n“But I think—\"\n\n“Dad, I’m fine, okay? I know you’re just worried about me. Don’t worry, I can do it all, I can serve my siblings, I can study and work at the same time. There’s no need for you to worry about, okay?” I said as I smiled at him. “By the way, would you like me to make some coffee for you?”\n\n“No, I’m fine Sophie. Just take your rest already, I know you’re already tired. By the way, we’ll be having a family dinner tomorrow. You know that restaurant we used to eat at?”\n\nI nodded, “Yes. But, do you have any occasion tomorrow?”\n\n“Yes, I would like you to meet someone. Make sure you’ll go there after work, okay?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nDad stood up and patted me on my head, “Just always remember that I love you so much, Sophie.”\n\n“I love you so much, too, dad.”",

        "content": "Sophie's POV\n\nEveryone was already sitting on their chairs, talking to each other, when I finally arrived with my hair all over my face because of running just to make it on time.\n\n”S-Sorry, I’m late.” I said as I sat next to Sebastian. He smiled as soon as he saw me.\n\n“It’s alright, Sophie. At least you came,” said Dad.\n\n“Can you see yourself right now, Sophie? We’re having dinner with a very important person, and you’re there wearing a white t-shirt and a pair of black jeans with your hair looking like you just woke up?” my stepmother suddenly said to me.\n\nI lowered my head, “I’m sorry, I just came from school, so I wasn’t able to change my clothes.”\n\n“It’s alright, Sophie. Even if you wear rags, you’d still stand out.” Sebastian suddenly said, so I nudged him when I saw Sera and Samantha glaring at him.\n\n“Are you a fool? You just look like us, so if you say that we’re ugly, it’s like you’re saying that you’re ugly too.” Samantha retorted.\n\nDad suddenly cleared his throat. “Stop that childish argument, okay? Our guest will finally arrive soon, so fix yourselves.”\n\n“I’m still wondering who that guest is.” Aunt Natalie said.\n\n“You’ll meet him later.” Dad just replied.\n\nI fixed my shirt and combed my hair using my fingers. Me too, I’ve been thinking about that visitor. I wonder who that is because he seems to be so important to my father. Although I can also see him drinking some water every minute, he looks so nervous, and I don’t even know why.\n\n“Sophie, I have composed a new song again, you should hear it!” Seb whispered to me.\n\n“Really? Can I hear it now?”\n\n“Sure!”\n\nSeb then took out his phone and was about to put his earphones in my right ear when we suddenly heard loud footsteps coming towards us. Every one of us turned our heads towards the entrance of the restaurant. Dad suddenly stood up, and so we all followed him.\n\nMen wearing black suits were walking towards us. They all look familiar to me, but I just can’t remember where I saw them.\n\n“They look like a gang, or maybe agents,” Seb whispered.\n\nThen they formed a line and made a way in the middle. A tall man started walking in the middle, and only his footsteps could be heard. He was wearing a black tuxedo vest that fit his bulky, masculine body perfectly. His black hair was slicked back, and it was shining as if it had been waxed. He was holding a cigarette in his right hand while he was puffing on a smoke.\n\nI stared at his face, and that’s the only time I knew who he was. My eyes widened as I pointed a finger at him. “Y-YOU?!”\n\nEveryone looked at me, including the man. He looked surprised upon seeing me, too. He threw his smoke to the ground and smiled cockily. “We meet again.”\n\n“D-Do you know him, Sophie?” Dad asked me.\n\n“Yes, daddy, he was that man who—” I wasn’t able to continue what I was saying after realizing that it was so embarrassing. “I mean… yes, we already met yesterday…”\n\n“Daddy? You mean that woman is your daughter, too?” The man asked Daddy.\n\nDad nodded, “Y-Yes, she’s my youngest daughter.”\n\n“Your daughter, huh? She doesn’t look like you.” Said the bastard while looking at me. I glared at him and looked at my dad, who just nodded to me and smiled.\n\n“Why don’t we have a seat first? This restaurant serves delicious food, I’m sure you’ll like it, err….”\n\n“Vincent. You can just call me Vincent,” he said.\n\nAunt Natalie nodded with a smile, “Vincent, what a handsome name. My name’s Natalie, I’m Albert’s wife. And these two girls here are my daughters.”\n\n“H-Hi Vincent, I’m Stephanie.”\n\n“And I’m Sera.”\n\nThe two of them were looking at Vincent, smiling, but the bastard just ignored them and shifted his gaze to me instead. “Why don’t you introduce yourself, too?”\n\n“I’m Sophie,” I said without looking at him.\n\n“Sophie, beautiful name,” he said.\n\nDad cleared his throat again, “Should we order some food already?”\n\n“T-That’s right, let’s call the server.” Aunt Natalie agreed.\n\nMinutes passed, and we had already started eating. I couldn’t focus on my food because I could feel Vincent staring at me from his seat. That mere fact already makes my blood boil in anger.\n\n“He looks like a mafia boss, don’t you think?” Seb whispered again to me.\n\n“You’re right. He looks like a nymphomaniac,” I said, then we both laughed.\n\n“By the way, Albert, have you told them already the reason why we’re here?” Vincent spoke again. Why does he talk to my father like that? He doesn’t really have manners or respect.\n\nDad almost choked, so I handed him a glass of water. “Thanks, Sophie.”\n\n“Just eat slowly, Dad.”\n\n“Oh, so you haven’t said it yet?”\n\n“Said what?” Aunt Natalie asked.\n\nVincent crossed his arms. “Your husband owes me a huge amount of money. He couldn’t give me his company, so we came to a different agreement instead.”\n\n“D-Dad owes you money?” I asked as I looked at my dad to confirm it. “Is that true, Dad?”\n\nDaddy looked at us, especially me, before nodding, “T-That’s true.”\n\n“But that’s impossible, Dad, we don’t have debts. Why don’t you just pay him? We have lots of money anyway.” Said Seb.\n\n“So sorry to say, but even if you pay me with all of the money that you have, it wouldn’t lessen even fifty percent of his debt.”\n\nMy eyes widened. “D-Dad, is that---\n\n“Yes, that is true. I owe him everything. V-Vincent was the one who helped me build our company. We got to build that because of him…”\n\n“Dad…”\n\n“But what agreement would you have if we can’t pay you that huge amount of money?” Aunt Natalie asked.\n\nVincent leaned on his chair with his arms crossed, “He said he’s willing to give one of his daughters to me.”\n\nAll of us were shocked. We all looked at Daddy, and he just lowered his head, confirming it. “Albert, how can you do that to our daughters?!”\n\n“Daddy! Why did you do that?! You agreed with this man?!” Seb yelled.\n\n“I’m so sorry… I had no choice… I’m so sorry…” Dad kept mumbling.\n\nVincent suddenly stood up, “So, can I have the payment now?”\n\n“Vincent… Can we just talk about this? I-I already changed my mind, I-I’ll just pay you. I don’t care if you take my company from me… just don’t…don’t take any of my daughters away from me…” Dad pleaded.\n\n“You should have said that earlier. I've changed my mind now; I don’t want money because I already have it. I want your daughter.” Vincent said.\n\n“V-Vincent…”\n\n“I’ll get that woman beside you,” Vincent said while looking at me.",

His loud yet deep voice reverberated through the restaurant.\n\n“S-Sorry… I already changed my mind. I-I don’t want to give my daughter…”\n\nWe were all surprised when all of a sudden, Vincent pulled out a gun and pointed it to my father’s head. “You know I hate people who break their promise. Now, just choose. Will you give me that woman or I’ll blow your brains out?”\n\n“Father!”\n\n“Honey!”\n\n“No! Please",

Actually, I’m still waiting for him to come back. I hope he changes his mind and realizes that we just want what’s best for him. He’s my only yo",

        "content": "\"You should definitely consider sending Everett that picture of yourself.\" With a tap on the screen, a provocative selfie of me lying without a top in my bed appeared.\n\nI responded with a playful giggle, refraining from sharing that particular photo. \"No, that one doesn't accentuate my features. How about this one instead?\" I selected another image of me positioned against a wall wearing black lacy lingerie, with my legs spread apart. In the photo, I held a small silver vibrator against my undergarments, my tongue out and my eyes closed.\n\nAda suggested nonchalantly, \"Why not send both?\"\n\nAn arched eyebrow was my immediate reaction.\n\n\"What? It wouldn't hurt to give him more options when looking at your pictures, if you catch my drift,\" she added, making a suggestive pelvic motion with her hand.\n\nI stared at the pictures, considering Ada's proposal. She did make a valid point. Honestly, even just gazing at them was getting me aroused. I could only begin to imagine what his reaction would be. I knew he would immediately be thirsty of me and I really wanted that.\n\nI scrolled to Everett’s name in my phone and texted him the two pictures with the caption: Wish you were here with me. ;)\n\nWhen I put my phone down, Ada smiled widely. “When are you gonna see him next? Maybe you two can finally get it on!”\n\nI rolled onto my stomach and kicked my feet into the air. “He and his dad are supposed to come over to have dinner tomorrow night.”\n\nEverett’s dad, Mr. Williams, and my dad worked at CloseNet Engineering, a company they had started together fifteen years ago. Since then, our families had weekly dinners together, went on vacations together, even spent holidays together.\n\n“Everett has been such a tease lately,” I said, thinking back to all of the dirty texts he’d sent me. I squeezed my knees together.\n\nThrough high school, Everett and I had flirted on and off with each other. But nothing ever happened. He was a bad boy, a player, every girl’s wet dream. We just never had the chance, which was partly my fault. Whenever he came on to me, I pushed him away, loving the thought of teasing him.\n\nI got wet, just thinking about him being out on dates with all these sexy women and opening one of my dirty texts or pictures. Him placing his phone down on the table, his hand pressing against his hard-on, trying to calm himself down. Ending up excusing himself to jerk off in the bathroom.\n\nDamn, I had touched myself to those fantasies one too many times. I was tempted to just let him have me already.\n\nBefore Ada left for the day, she made me promise to text her as soon as Everett replied. But whenever I checked my phone, there were no messages from him.\n\nAt four p.m., my knees were bouncing up and down, my lip was drawn between my teeth, my heart was racing. He had always replied within minutes.\n\nMaybe he didn’t want to play this game anymore. Maybe sending two pictures was too many. I didn’t know, but I wanted to find out. What if something was wrong?\n\nMy phone buzzed, and I immediately jumped up and opened up the message.\n\nEverett Williams: Mila, I don’t think this is appropriate.\n\nMy heart sank in my chest. How could he not think it was appropriate? We had been texting back and forth like this for almost two months, and all of a sudden, he didn’t think it was okay. Where was that snarky remark of his?\n\nMe: What do you mean? You didn’t like the pictures?\n\nHe replied within seconds.\n\nEverett Williams: Oh no, I love them. I’m hard, just looking at them. If I could, I’d take you to bed.\n\nMe: Then, what’s the problem, Everett? Come over. My dad’s at work.\n\nEverett Williams: Check who you’re texting.\n\nI gazed up at the contact, eyes widening. “Shit. How could I be so stupid?” My cheeks flamed with embarrassment. I reread the name over and over. Still not believing that I just sent my dirty, naked pictures to Everett’s dad.\n\nMe: OMG, I’m so sorry, Mr. Williams. I meant to send that to someone else. Please don’t tell my dad I sent those to you! I’m so embarrassed.\n\nI pulled the blankets over my head, trying to shield myself from the embarrassment that wouldn’t leave me alone. My cheeks felt like they were on fire; my heart was racing faster than it was before.\n\nMr. Williams: Don’t be embarrassed, Mila. You’re very sexy.\n\nMy eyes widened at his reply, and for a moment, my core burned. Mr. Williams was nearly my father’s age, but he had always been undeniably attractive. Ada and I had a huge crush on him in high school.\n\nI took a deep breath and decided to keep my response short.\n\nMe: Thanks.\n\nHe didn’t reply to me, and I didn’t know what to think. I just prayed that he wouldn’t tell Dad about the pictures.\n\nAnd just to be certain, I hid from Dad when he came home from work. Didn’t even come out for dinner. Didn’t say good night to him. Just stayed in my room, hid under my covers, and ignored everyone’s texts, including Everett’s.\n\nEarly the next morning, he knocked on my door and stepped into my room. The sunrays flooded through my window. “Mila, is there anything you want to tell me about?”\n\nMy eyes widened, and I sat up in bed. “Uh, no. Why?” I asked, clutching the blankets in my sweaty palms.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “You usually come downstairs and have dinner with us. Are you sick?”\n\nI smiled at my dad, relief washing over me. “Oh, I just wasn’t feeling that well,” I lied.\n\n“Well, hopefully, you’re feeling better by tonight. Everett and his father are coming over for dinner,” he said. Then, he kissed my head and left for work.",

        "content": "I grabbed my macroeconomics textbook from my backpack and opened it up to the chapters that I needed to study for my college exam next Monday while trying to stop thinking about tonight. Because if I did, I would get nothing done.\n\nMy phone, which I had intentionally placed facedown on the bed, buzzed. I gazed over at it, heart racing. One minute passed, then two, then I couldn’t control the urge to flip it over and see Mr. Williams’s name on the screen.\n\nMr. Williams: I look forward to seeing you tonight, Mila.\n\nI stared at the text with wide eyes and fanned myself. My God. What did I say to that?\n\nAfter deciding to ignore the text, I turned the page in my textbook and started studying. But I kept glancing over at my phone, sitting, waiting for him to send me another text.\n\nThe screen lit up with a longer message.\n\nMr. Williams: Are you ignoring me? I could just tell your father about those pictures if you want.\n\nAs soon as I saw his message, I picked up the phone.\n\nMe: No! No, not ignoring you. Please don’t tell my dad.\n\nMr. Williams: It’s going to be quite difficult to keep something like this from him, but another picture might make it a bit easier.\n\nI pursed my lips together, core tightening. He wanted another dirty picture of me? I … I couldn’t. I placed my phone down and took a deep breath. I should call Ada; she would know what to do. I picked up my phone, ready to dial her number, but another text from him popped up.\n\nMr. Williams: I’m sitting next to your dad in a meeting right now. ;)\n\nFuck.\n\nMe: Okay, okay. Just give me a second.\n\nI scrolled through my phone, looking through all of the naked pictures of myself and trying to find one without my face in it because if this man was going to blackmail me, at least these pictures wouldn’t have my face in them.\n\nWhen I finally selected one, I sat on my bed, finger hovering over the blue Send button. My knees bounced up and down. I squeezed my eyes closed and sent it.\n\nMr. Williams: I want one with you naked and on your knees, looking into the camera.\n\nI shut my eyes tightly. Why was this happening? How could this be happening? I sent my dirty pictures to Dad’s partner and ended up in this situation.\n\nBut I really, really didn’t want Dad to see or even know about the pictures. Last time he caught me sexting, he threatened to take away my college fund.\n\n“A lady doesn’t act that way,” he had said.\n\nSo, I took my clothes off, knelt on the floor, and looked into the camera. My nipples were hard. My stomach was sucked in. My lips were pursed. I needed the picture to be perfect because I really, really didn’t want to retake it for him.\n\nAfter I sent the stupid picture, I lay on my bed. My pussy throbbed at the thought of him in his meeting, dick hard against his pants. Him trying to hide his hard-on in front of Dad. I pushed my hand in my pants, teasing my clit.\n\nGod, everything about it was so fucking hot.\n\nA few hours passed, and he didn’t text me back. I hoped that was enough to keep him over and to keep his mouth shut.\n\nAt seven p.m., Dad yelled upstairs to me, “Mila, the Williams are here.”\n\nI grabbed my phone and smoothed out my conservative navy-blue dress. Making sure all of the goodies were covered up. I didn’t want Mr. Williams to get the wrong idea, especially with my family at the dinner table.\n\nWhen I walked down the stairs, my heart was pounding against my chest. Everyone was sitting at the dinner table, waiting for me. As soon as I stepped into the room, Mr. Williams’s blue eyes pierced through mine. His cream sweater hugged his body.\n\nBad-boy Everett was giving me that look he always did. Deep. Dark. Dangerous. Yet all I could think about was how I took a picture of myself, sitting on my knees, breasts on full display, and eyes wide, looking like I was waiting for his father’s cock.\n\nMy cheeks flushed, and I sat down next to him at the table. Only wishing that this dinner would go as smoothly as every other one had. But of course, things never went as planned.\n\nHalfway through dinner, my phone buzzed in my lap.\n\nMr. Williams: Put your vibrator inside of you.\n\nI stared, wide-eyed, at the phone and gazed up at Mr. Williams to see him in conversation with my dad.\n\nMe: I don’t have a vibrator.\n\nAfter I replied, I went back to talking to Everett.\n\nFrom the corner of my eye, I watched Mr. Williams look down at his phone and glance at me.\n\nHe didn’t respond. Instead, he cleared his throat.\n\n“Steve,” he said, looking at my dad, “did you know that your daughter has excellent photography skills?”\n\nMy eyes widened as I glared at him, shock running through my veins. He smirked.\n\nDad smiled. “No, I didn’t. You’re interested in photography, sweetie?”\n\nOh, fuck me. I forced a smile on my face. “Yes.”\n\n“Why haven’t we seen any of your work?” he asked.\n\nI clenched my jaw, anger boiling inside of me. Why did he have to do this now? “I like keeping it to myself,” I stated, hoping he would drop the subject.\n\n“I have some of her pictures, if you would like to see them,” Mr. Williams started.",

        "content": "My cheeks flushed red, and I stood up from my seat. “No! I’ll go, uh … get some of my pictures that I’ve taken. They’re in my room. It's much better than a picture on a phone. You can’t ever see anything on those things. I’ll be right back,” I said, leaping out of my chair.\n\nBefore I left the room, I gave Mr. Williams a pointed stare, trying to tell him that I was going to go get that damn vibrator and put it inside of me. For him.\n\n“Fuck!” I said once I rushed into my room. “This really can’t be happening.”\n\nI searched for a picture that looked semi-decent to bring down to show my parents. Luckily, I found one that Ada had taken a few years ago that she gave me.\n\nI removed it from the frame and then grabbed my vibrator and buried it inside of me. A soft vibration pulsed through my core, and I silently cursed. This was going to be a long night.\n\nWhen I made it back downstairs, I gave my parents the picture and sat with my legs crossed on my chair, my panties soaked. Mr. Williams was smirking at me.\n\nIt’s inside. I hope you’re happy, I texted him.\n\nI’m more than happy, he said.\n\nHe put down his utensil and slipped his hand under the table. I closed my eyes and gripped the bottom of my seat, core tightening around the vibrator. The pressure built between my legs, and I tried to pull myself out of the dirty, dirty thoughts that I was thinking about, like Mr. Williams thrusting himself inside of me.\n\n“Mila! This picture is beautiful!” Mom said.\n\nI gave her a forced smile and glanced at Mr. Williams. I knotted my eyebrows together. The pressure was too much. If this continued, I was going to come apart right here in front of everyone.\n\nMr. Williams loosened his collar slightly and reached for his phone. I just want to bend you over this table and pound into you.\n\nMy legs trembled at his words. I clenched my jaw, trying to keep a neutral expression.\n\n“So, Mila, when did you get into photography?” Mr. Williams asked.\n\nI pulled my seat in, hips moving slightly against the seat itself. Everyone stared at me, waiting for my answer.\n\n“I, uh, I started … like … maybe …” I said. I could barely focus. I pressed my breasts against the table, loving the cold feeling of marble against my nipples. “Uh …”\n\nMr. Williams smirked.\n\n“Three months ago … maybe?”\n\n“Do you like it?” he asked. I could taste his hunger from across the table.\n\nI bit my lip and nodded my head at him. “Can I be excused? I-I have to do some … difficult homework for my economics class,” I said. I needed to get this damn vibrator out of me before I came in front of my parents.\n\n“Of course, sweetie,” Mom said with a smile.\n\n“I can help,” Mr. Williams said.\n\n“Oh.” I grabbed the table, fingertips turning white, core tight. “No. I don’t think—” I almost collapsed as i could hear the trembling in my voice and i was sure everyone could hear it too.\n\n“Mila, he’s the businessman of the company. Take advantage of him while he’s here,” Dad said.\n\nI gazed at Dad, then Mr. Williams.\n\n“I would love to help, Mila. Why don’t you go show me what it is that’s hard for you?”\n\n“Okay,” I said quietly. I jumped out of my seat, crossing my legs over one another and stumbling out of the room.\n\nMr. Williams followed me upstairs. As soon as I entered my room, I leaned over my bed and moaned softly. God, it felt so good.\n\nHe closed the door softly behind me and pushed me onto the bed. The bed dipped next to me. He grazed his fingers inside of my thigh, making me clench even harder.\n\nAnd as his fingers skimmed across my wet panties, I whimpered. He slipped a finger inside and began rubbing circles around my clit.\n\n“Mr. Williams, I-I …” I stuttered.\n\nI moaned out as he pulled the vibrator out of me. His warm breath fanned my neck, and he peppered wet kisses down it. Leaning over on one of his elbows, he pushed his fingers inside of me. I gripped on to his wrist as he thrust them deeper.\n\nThe sound of my wet pussy being thrust into over and over made me wetter.\n\nAfter a few moments, he pulled his fingers out of me and placed them on my lips. “Suck on it,” he demanded.\n\nI wrapped my lips around his fingers and sucked my wetness off as I gazed at him through my lashes. He took a deep breath and closed his hungry eyes as he undid his belt.\n\n“Fuck, Mila.” He crawled off of the bed, pulled down his pants, and smirked down at me.\n\nHis fingers gripped my underwear from underneath my dress, and he slowly pulled them off of me. He brushed his fingers down the insides of my thighs. I stood, craving his touch, and pressed my lips to his.\n\nHe tangled his hand in my hair and pulled me back with it. “Turn around.”\n\nI turned around and placed my hands on the bed. With one hand, he fingered the bottom of my dress and pulled it up. With the other, he grabbed a fistful of my hair, forcing me to arch my back. He rubbed his hard cock against my entrance.\n\n“Please,” I whispered. “Please, Mr. Williams.”\n\nHe pushed himself into me slowly. I clenched the bedsheets in my hand as his cock filled me. He wrapped an arm around my torso and groped my breast through my dress, softly tugging on my earlobe.\n\n“You have no idea how much power I have over you, Mila,” he murmured. He thrust harder into me. “Anything I want, you can and will give me.”\n\nI gripped the bedsheets harder, thrusting my hips back against his. “What do you want?”\n\n\"You, on your knees.”",

        "content": "My toes curled. I gazed up at him, fingers rubbing my clit. He took my chin in his hand, and I opened my mouth. His cum sprayed over my face, completely missing my mouth. When he released my jaw, I wiped his cum off with my fingers and sucked them into my mouth.\n\nHe smirked down at me and pinched both of my nipples in his fingers, pulling me up. I stumbled back onto the bed. He pushed his fingers inside of me again.\n\nSomeone knocked on my door.\n\n“How’s everything coming along in there?” Dad asked.\n\nI bit my lip, trying to hold back my moans, and dug my nails into his shoulders. He pounded his fingers deeper inside of me. I arched my back and threw my head back.\n\n“It’s coming along.” Mr. Williams chuckled. My fingers dug deeper into his skin as I desperately tried to keep my moans quiet. “Isn’t it, Mila?”\n\nMy legs trembled as the pleasure pulsed out of me. “Yes,” I said.\n\nI listened—quite distantly—to Dad’s footsteps padding away. And when he did, I sank into the bed and took a deep breath. This was definitely not how I was expecting this night to go.\n\nWhen we finished, we walked back down to the dining room as if nothing had happened.\n\nDad smiled at me as we entered. “Did you finish?”\n\nMy face flushed red, and I nodded my head. “Yeah, Mr. Williams is going to have to help me more often. He is really great at it.”\n\nI sat back down, and he took his seat as well.\n\nDad turned to Mr. Williams. “Would you mind if I saw those pictures Mila sent you of her photography? I know you love buying new artwork and commissioning photography, but I didn’t know my daughter was such an artist, and I want to see more.”\n\nMr. Williams smirked across the table at me.\n\n“Dad, you don’t want to see them,” I said, digging my fingers into my palms.\n\nMr. Williams took out his phone. “Come on, Mila. Have some confidence in yourself. They are amazing.”\n\nI sat in my Entrepreneurship Intermediate class, watching Professor Reynolds prepare the materials for today’s class.\n\nIt was a Saturday morning, and Reynolds decided to tell us last minute that we’d get extra credit for attending a guest lecturer’s presentation this morning. About half the class was there, a good twenty-five people in the decent-sized classroom.\n\nMost didn’t need to be here, but I did. Not because I wanted to, but because I needed the extra credit. I had been sliding by with a C-minus all semester—and that was me trying really, really hard. Studying for hours every night.\n\nListening intently to every single lecture. I just sucked at taking the exams, which was killing me.\n\n“He should be here any minute now,” Professor Reynolds said, gazing down at his watch.\n\nI tapped my thumb against my phone screen, staring between it and the door. Everett was supposed to be here, enduring this stupid hour-long lecture with me.\n\nThe screen lit up, no messages on it, making me excited for no reason at all. I pressed my thumb to the home button and opened my messages, gaze lingering on his.\n\nIt had been one long week since Mr. Williams had dinner at my house, had come into my room, and had fucked me hard while my whole family sat at the kitchen table.\n\nHe hadn’t asked for another picture. He hadn’t asked for me to text him again. Everything was too silent from him, and that made my heart race. Every night, I waited for Dad to say something to me about him, but he hadn’t said a single word.\n\nWetness pooled between my legs as I stared at all the messages we had sent back and forth. The pictures of me topless and on my knees for him.\n\nMy whole naked body on full display for him to jerk off to every night. His hand around his big cock, stroking it to me, thinking about the way he felt inside of me, pumping in and out and in and out, faster and faster. Tugging on my nipples. Touching my clit.\n\nI closed my eyes, the pressure in my core building higher and higher, and I hadn’t even touched myself yet. The door opened, and I tried my hardest to push away the dirty thoughts of Everett’s dad when I was about to see Everett.\n\nAfter opening my eyes, I smiled widely at Everett, who strolled into the room with Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams’s gaze shifted around the entire room, then eventually landed on me. His eyes lit up for the briefest moment, the corner of his lip curling into a smirk.\n\nI pressed my lips together. He was our guest speaker? Great. Great. Great. I tore my gaze away from him, pinning a tight smile on my face when Everett slid into the seat next to me.\n\n“Hey, babe.”\n\nBabe. The nickname he gave everyone who was even remotely attractive to him.\n\n“Your dad is the guest speaker?” I asked, brows furrowed together.\n\nHe rolled his eyes, leaned back in his seat, and crossed his big arms over one another, making his biceps bulge.\n\n“Yep.”\n\nFrom his one-worded response, I could tell that he didn’t particularly like that fact. Everett wasn’t close to failing this class, but his father must’ve made him come.\n\nProfessor Reynolds and Mr. Williams spoke for a few moments in the front of the room. I grasped my phone hard in my hand until my knuckles turned white.\n\nThis was not how I was expecting my day to start out. I just wanted a relaxing Saturday for the first time since this semester started. Not one where I was flustered for a whole hour.\n\nI couldn’t ignore the warmth pooling between my legs.",

        "content": "Reynolds cleared his throat, introducing the topic we’d be talking about today and going over some announcements, like he did at the start of every class, and a moment later, my phone buzzed.\n\nI swallowed hard, wanting to ignore it … but I couldn’t ignore the warmth pooling between my legs. So, I turned the brightness on my phone all the way down and opened the message from Everett’s dad.\n\nI have something for you.\n\nMy heart raced, and I drew my knees together. Mr. Williams had something for me.\n\nBe a good girl and play with yourself back there during my presentation, and maybe I’ll give it to you when class is over.\n\nI swallowed hard, staring down at the message.

Over this desk when we were finished? In one of the many empty bedrooms at his house? Maybe on his office desk in the middle of the workday while everyone listened.\n\nMy cheeks flushed. I typed and retyped my message to him about ten times, unsure about how I should respond to him.\n\n“And no cell phones, Miss Mila.” Professor Reynolds stood in front of my desk, arms crossed over his chest, giving me a pointed stare. My cheeks flushed a deeper red, and I parted my lips to say something—anything at all——but he stopped me. “Do you want me to take the extra credit point away from you?”\n\nMy eyes widened, and I stuffed my phone into my backpack. “No, sir, sorry.” My gaze flickered to Mr. Williams. “It won’t happen again. Mr. Williams has my full attention.”\n\nAfter Reynolds introduced Mr. Williams as the CEO of CloseNet Engineering, Mr. Williams placed his phone down on the podium in front of him and started his boring lecture about what an entrepreneur really was and how much work it really took and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAll I did was sit there, staring at him from the back of the classroom, with his son right next to me and ground my legs together, needing to feel some type of friction between my thighs.\n\nMy eyes closed briefly, and when I reopened them, he was staring right at me, his eyes flickering to my legs. There was a ring of fire in his eyes as he stared.\n\nI crossed my arms over my chest, brows furrowing together, and tugged lightly on my nipples through my bra without drawing Everett’s unwanted attention to me.\n\nMy lips parted, a rush of pleasure hitting my core. I moved my hips slowly against the chair, just needing Mr. Williams to be inside of me. I hadn’t stopped thinking about him since last week.\n\nAll I had imagined was his big cock sliding down my throat, sitting on his desk, getting pounded by the CEO of Dad’s company.\n\nI gnawed on the inside of my lip and pulled out my phone. I should’ve been giving Mr. Williams my full attention … but I wanted to have his full attention, and I knew the perfect way to do that.\n\nSo, I hid my phone under the desk, scrolled through my private photo album, and chose a picture I had sent Everett a while ago. It was me in a schoolgirl skirt and a tight white tank top.\n\nMy nipples were pressed against the material, and everything—I mean, everything—was on full display to him.\n\nAfter pressing my knees together, I sent the message. His phone buzzed against the hardwood podium. He paused, gazing down at it, and clenched his jaw. His breath hitched, and for a moment, I swore he stumbled over his words.\n\n“There are”—he grasped the top of his tie, tugging on it just enough—“barriers …”\n\nI sucked in a deep breath. All I wanted him to do was step out from behind the podium and show me how hard my picture had made him.\n\nI gazed down at my phone, about to send him another picture, when Professor Reynolds appeared at my desk. I quickly tapped on the home button, my text messages disappearing, and stared up at him with wide eyes.\n\n“Give me the phone, Mila,” he said, trying to stay quiet, but the whole class had heard him.\n\nI pressed my lips together, shutting it off so he couldn’t go through it, and placed the phone in his hand.\n\n“I’m disappointed in you. Your extra credit has been forfeited.”\n\nMy eyes widened, and I cursed myself. There went passing this class.\n\nMr. Williams gave me a small, hidden smirk from the podium, and I slouched down in my seat. He continued his stupid lecture for the next fifteen minutes while I sat in my seat, arms crossed over my chest, panties soaked.\n\nThe pressure had dissipated, yet that linger had remained. That linger of a promise. Mr. Williams had something for me, and I had done as he asked. Well, sorta.\n\nBy the way he continued to gaze at me with those dark, dangerous eyes … it was enough for that linger to grow until I had the urge to push my hand back under the table again and touch myself in front of everyone for him.\n\nBut I didn’t. Instead, I sat in my chair like a good girl and tried my hardest to stop thinking all these dirty thoughts about him.\n\nWhen class was over, I gathered all of my belongings, stuffing them inside my backpack. Everett bashed Professor Reynolds to me for him taking my phone, but I just told Everett I didn’t care that it happened and hoped to God he’d leave before his father did.\n\nAll the other students the class, but I waited behind as Mr. Williams and Professor Reynolds talked.\n\nI needed that damn phone before anyone went through it. They would find out everything. Everything.",

Alright, see you soon”\n\n“As you heard, your father wants you back now. You better get dressed so I can drive you back home. I wouldn’t want to keep my dear brother waiting to have dinner with his beloved daughter for too long, now can I? ... come down to the car when you’re done.”\n\nI was still exhausted from our steamy session as I felt his cock gliding out of me followed by the mix of our love juices spilling out of my opening onto my legs and the floor. That was when I realized that this was the first time in my life that I did it raw and had a man’s seed buried deep inside me. The smell of our sex hung heavily in the room along with the silence as my uncle dressed and left without saying another word.\n\nI dressed up as fast as I could in my state of confusion and grabbed my bag before h",

After entering high school, I came to dislike calling my stepfather as ‘father’ so we have been calling each other by our names and that makes me feel so happy. I walked towards the dining room where I believe Lucien must be waiting for me.\n\n“Hi there! I’m Angela! Nice to finally meet you, Natalia.” A blond woman with sparkling blue eyes, gigantic tits, and a curvy ass in a tight dress stood up from the table to greet me with an overly friendly hug.\n\n“Hi. It’s Natalia. Nice to meet you too,” I replied politely, plastering on my face one of the sweet smiles that I have been trained to present during social gathering occasions.\n\nMy eyes darted around to try to locate Lucien. He was nowhere in sight. Where is he? ... and who is she? We both sat down at the dinner table where three courses of meal ha",

We stared at each other as I seductively swallowed his seed.\n\nA few minutes after that the car came to a stop. Looking out the window, I guess we were in the outskirts of town. I could see green forest everywhere and there was a lake nearby. The place surely had beautiful scenery but it was clearly secluded and no one was around. Ok ... why are we here?

        "content": "“T-Tamara,” a frantic shook in her arms and a trembling voice from her mother woke her up.\n\n“Mom,” she sleepily called her while she was still in her dream state and getting up from her comfy bed.\n\nShe focused her eyes while trying to look at the clock placed on her bedside table. It said that it was almost midnight.\n\nWhy would her mother visit her at this hour? Her eighteenth birthday was two days ago. Would she receive another birthday present?\n\nHer heart beat fast, and she smiled sweetly due to her excitement; however, her mother’s face said otherwise, which wiped up her joyous smile for a moment.\n\n“Get up, Tamara. Y-you need to get away.”\n\nHer mother was quivering, and that made her wake to her full senses, making her heartbeat speedily — now because of worry.\n\nIs this some kind of a joke or a prank?\n\nBut her mother wasn’t a fan of any kind of prank, especially not like this. She was always tenderly strict towards her. Her forehead creased as she saw her bothered face looking at the locked door to her room.\n\n“What is happening, Mom?” she asked as she was trying to be calm, though her senses were in a panic mode now.\n\nHer mother looked at her with watering eyes that made her bump with abrupt edginess and discomfort.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\n“Honey, y-you n-need to go. Remember the forest that I told you to go to in case of an emergency? Someone will pick you up there. Now, off you go, my child. I-I love you. Your dad and I love you s-so much.” Her voice cracked as her fresh tears flowed down from her cheeks.\n\nTamara hugged her mom tightly, never wanting to hear those words as if it was the last time they would see each other. Her eyes blurred with unshed tears as she tried to comfort her mother and her heartbroken self.\n\n“W-what is happening, Mom? Where is Dad?” she repeatedly asked. Her lips were quivering and her voice hoarse from containing her mixed emotions.\n\nHer mother broke their embrace and locked her face with her cold hands. They were so cold that she wanted to close her eyes and give her warmth — however, she was quietly curious about her abrupt actions — it intensified her anxiety.\n\n“There’s no room for questions now, Tamara. You need to go. You know there’s an exit in your closet, right? Go there. Faster, please,” her mother grabbed her hand, and she was immediately out of her bed.\n\nHer mom quickly assisted her in front of her massive closet and opened it widely.\n\nA sudden bang and crashing of glass broke the lull of silence inside their house, making both of their eyes widen in shock.\n\nTamara heard a loud growl and gasping mixing through the air that reached her ears.\n\nShe could feel her mother’s trembling hands.\n\n“M-Mom, w-what is happening? I can’t leave you h-here. How about you and D-Dad?” She nervously asked for the nth time while her gaze moved towards the locked door.\n\nShe was more worried and horrified now. Her mother cleared the lump in her throat, and she could feel her restlessness. Her dark brown eyes filled with fear and sadness as they looked at her. She became more anxious as the seconds passed. She was close to hyperventilating now, but she wanted to portray her strong façade.\n\n“Tamara. Please, just get out of the house! It is more important that you’re safe. And please don’t ever look back,” her mother pleaded and pushed her gently inside her closet.\n\nIt is where her parents built an emergency exit down to their basement and a little pathway that leads to the forest.\n\nShe was using this way whenever she wanted to escape from her parents — now to escape someone she doesn’t even know.\n\nShe could feel her mom’s shuddering cold hands holding her arms. Her mother looked at the locked door of her room and then back at her. They heard a loud thud and a snarl.\n\n“But M-Mom—”\n\n“Enough! Save yourself! Promise me, don’t look back. You need to run! Please.” Her voice became low and pleading.\n\nShe saw how determined and hopeless her mom was — determined to get her out of the house and hopeless on something.\n\n“P-please… Promise me, huh?” She begged desperately.\n\nShe slowly nodded her head as she stifled her unshed tears.\n\n“P-promise…” Tamara breathily answered.\n\nHer mother gave her a warm and loving smile and kissed her forehead before pushing her down the exit door.\n\nIt was a slide way down to the basement. Tamara’s tears flowed down her cheeks. She didn’t know what was happening, and she was frighteningly shocked.\n\nShe finally felt the soft cushion, and it made her realize that she was already on the basement floor. Her legs were wobbling — she could hear the tinny noise coming from the upper part of their house where her room was.\n\nShe tried to stand up, but her eyes were blurred by her tears. She accidentally nudged the antique ceramic vase standing near her. It created a loud crash sound followed by a loud and eerie growl.\n\nHer spine shivered as she heard that menacing growl.\n\nShe pulled herself together, trying to find the pathway that would lead her to the forest. Her heart was pounding tough and fast, making her chest ache a bit. She heard debauched and loud steps getting nearer to where she was.\n\nFinally, she pulled the cover of the pathway to open it. It was just a small tunnel, and she needed to crawl through it. It was just as big as her size so it made it difficult for her to move. She did a nonstop crawl, never wanting any chance for the intruder to catch her.\n\nShe was doing her best to crawl as fast as she could — no matter how difficult it was for her. She could hear scratching sounds echoing in the tunnel that made her flinch. She ignored the foul smell, even her bruised knees and elbows caused by the concrete pavement.\n\nShe heard a loud snarl followed by gasping and panting, then a weakened cry.\n\nShe closed her eyes firmly as the tears flowed freely.\n\nAfter minutes of nonstop crawling, she finally reached the end of the tunnel.\n\nShe tried to push the cover for it to open and she stopped a bit to gasp for air. She just realized that she’s holding her breath for a moment already.\n\nShe tried to push it again, but it just wouldn’t budge. Her eyes started to water once again. Her nose was now red and icky from all her crying.\n\nShe felt hopeless. She felt weak. She felt tired.\n\nThen, she heard a cracking sound coming from the other side of the tunnel.\n\n“N-no,” she silently whispered.\n\nShe was trembling and couldn’t even move an inch because of fear.\n\nShe was about to crawl back to the house when the cover burst wide open.\n\nA man who looked like in his mid-fifties met her eyes.\n\n“Good thing you’re already here, Tamara. I’m Benson.” His voice was low but signified authority.\n\nHis eyes were as dark as the night. He had little freckles visible on his forehead, and some were on the upper part of his cheeks. His hair was grayish and neatly done.\n\nHe offered his firm hand to her for her to grab on to, but she didn’t even bother to accept it or look at it.\n\nThe man was muscular and quite tall. His face was laced with no emotion — at all. It was plain and blank — that made her inaudibly cry out because of unsolicited fear.\n\nShe just looked at him, still confused and shaken from everything that was happening.\n\n“Come on, Tamara. I won’t hurt you. I’m here to fetch you,” he said. His tone never faltered — it was still low and authoritative all throughout.\n\nShe couldn’t fathom whether he was telling the truth or not. Besides, her parents told her not to trust anyone easily. But she remembered that her mother had told her that someone was waiting for her in the forest.\n\nShe was hesitatingly reaching for his waiting hand, and he pulled her. His muscular biceps contracted as he carried her full, heavy weight. He didn’t care, though — based on him having no reaction — as if she was just as light as a feather.\n\nHer legs swayed as it stepped to the ground, making her lean on the tiny tunnel behind her to find strength and support. She clenched her fist as she tried to compose herself, taking a deep breath and embracing the cold wind that passed through her delicate skin.\n\nShe wasn’t trusting this man — or anyone. In the meantime, she wanted to get away from whoever had trespassed in their house and find out what was happening. For this man, well, she’ll just cross the bridge when she gets there.\n\nIt was past midnight, and the new moon wasn’t helping her see the surroundings so much as the flickering lamp post standing near them.\n\nHer eyes were bloodshot, and her tears flowed endlessly. Her lips quivered as she tried to control her sobs that mixed with the low growling sounds and the owl hooting that echoed the entire forest.\n\n“Who are you?” Her voice was gruff as she asked him.\n\n“I’m Benson,” he answered, just repeating his name and nothing more.\n\nTamara’s palm flew to her forehead, trying to stifle her mixed emotions.\n\n“What I mean is, why are you here? Why won’t you help my parents? Why did you know me?” she asked hysterically.\n\nHer voice cracked as her trembling hands motioned to their house, which was covered with many lofty trees, and she couldn’t see where they were standing.\n\n“We need to go,” Benson told her and turned around. He started walking to the depths of the woods, ignoring her pressing questions.\n\n“H-how about my parents?” Tamara eagerly asked as she followed the man as if she had no other choice.\n\n“They were dead,” he informed her without any sign of remorse — or any other emotion at that. He just said it as plainly as if it was just a common thing during a conversation.\n\nHer heart sank to her stomach, and her heartbeat stopped for a second before its beats doubled. It was a bomb to her ears, making her deaf for a matter of seconds. It weakened her knees, and she almost fell to the ground, if not to the trunk of the tree that supported her weight.\n\n“W-what?” she asked in a low voice.\n\nShe would not believe what he just said — or maybe she’s hoping that she heard him wrong.\n\nHe stopped walking and heaved a deep sigh, as if he were extending his patience to her, still not facing her.\n\n“Winston and Ameia, they were dead,” he said casually.\n\nAs simple as that.\n\nHe mentioned her parents’ names. He knew them.\n\n“H-how did you know?” She hopelessly inquired, still trying to collect herself for the hasty news.\n\nTamara tried to control her emotions by looking for loopholes in his answers. That certain statement that answered her questions lingered inside her mind, making her head spin in madness.\n\nShe would not believe this man. Her parents weren’t dead. They…\n\nTamara gritted her teeth as she tried to compose herself, but the tears pooling in her eyes and streaming endlessly down to her pale pink cheeks weren’t helping her at all.\n\nShe could feel her strength slowly vanishing from thin air as she tried to clench her hands firmly as if it would help her regain it and hold onto it.\n\nShe stifled her forlorn sobs, but the sound of it still resonated with the melancholic ambiance in the dark woods.\n\nBenson finally faced her. Despite her blurring vision, she saw how his eyes glistened and turned pitch black — his face was still void and cold. He pressed his lips tightly, and before she knew it, her entire system was shaken by the following words he said.\n\n“Because I can already smell the strong scent of their flesh and blood.” With that, her mind went black, and she instantly fell to the ground.",

He was in the throne room thinking about something nonsense when Arlan graced him with his presence, breaking the passive silence engulfing the entire room.\n\n“And so?” Hades asked mercilessly. His voice was pitch dark — without any sign of any emotion — and just plain blank and void.\n\nIt was his typical reaction, though — having no reaction at all. He was trained to be at that without anyone else by his side. Bitterness crept onto his tongue as it reached his stomach, which made him grit his teeth tightly. He didn’t want to do anything with this kind of feeling anymore. He was already done with all of it.\n\n“But Your Majesty—” Arlan stopped, stating his reasons the moment he raised his hand and stared at him warningly.\n\nArlan swallowed hard as he silently hoped that his shaking legs would also fade away like the lump in his throat. He didn’t want to make him mad, but this wasn’t the time for him to wear his well-made and tough mask.\n\n“Your regina was in danger, my king,” he restlessly proclaimed as he watched how the king clenched his fist on the armrest of his golden throne.\n\nHis eyes turned pitch black, and it narrowed directly at him, making Arlan’s heart beat in an unusual manner — faster than normal — as his legs wobbled down and bullets of sweat gathered on his forehead due to fear and edginess.\n\n“I don’t have a ‘regina,’” King Hades’ jaw gnawed firmly as he loudly growled at him, making his canines bare.\n\nArlan trembled more in fear, but his face remained stoic. The king’s aura turned authoritative and irrefutably held power as darkness covered his entire being.\n\nHe was the Alpha King of All Wolf Borne — as a matter of fact, that statement could already send chills down anyone’s spine. And Arlan wasn’t an exemption, regardless of how long he’d been serving as one of the loyal and efficient kingsmen.\n\nHe undeniably knew what he could do to anyone, like he could kill him in a matter of seconds where he was standing right now by using only his bare hands. But being one of his subordinates, he also needed to do his duties, even if it meant sacrificing his own life.\n\n“But—”\n\nHe curled up his lips upward — his notable devilish smirk appeared on his face — that could make anyone totter in terror.\n\n“Choose now, Arlan. Do I need to cut your throat this instant, or do I have to care about your rubbish, nonsensical words?” His menacing deep voice sent shivers down his spine, making him bite his tongue and swallow his unsaid words.\n\nFor Arlan knew the king’s words — once sealed, and it could never be broken.\n\nArlan bowed his head as he clenched both his fists to stop trembling. “I apologize for my despicable behavior, your Majesty.”\n\nWith that, he knew he couldn’t do anything right now.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, in the depths of the woods, Tamara was running as fast as she could to escape someone.\n\nThick fog enveloped the lofty trees as the hooting of the night owl continued echoing to the depths of the forest, making her more distracted and petrified. She didn’t know where to go, nor did she know where the heck she was.\n\n“Run!”\n\nShe could hear someone screaming as it resonated through the trees and mixed with the hustling wind. Birds were flying, leaving their nests on the tall trees, because of the unexpected sound that broke the deafening silence.\n\nHer vision was spinning so as her mind was in deep haywire. She was gasping for air, but she didn’t stop in her tracks and continuously ran without knowing where exactly to go — until she was outbalanced and painfully fell on the ground.\n\nShe felt the pain slowly creep into her palms and knees, but she didn’t care. She tried to stand up, but her knees trembled and couldn’t find their strength. Miserable sobs escaped through her trembling lips as it clogged her throat.\n\nTamara felt so helpless and miserable — for the very first time in her life.\n\nShe was wretchedly lying on the ground and squeezing her eyes shut tightly.\n\nShe needed to gain strength — something was running after her. She needed to escape — and fast. A loud, terrifying snarl reached her ears, making her shudder with intense fear.\n\nShe slowly opened her eyes, but her blurry vision blocked her sight to whoever was sneering down at her. The sound of the strange animal moved closer and closer to where she was lying. She was glued to the ground where she was — she couldn’t even move an inch. She gasped loudly as a blatant growl echoed at her feet.\n\nA large wolf was ready to attack her, and she screamed as hard as she could!\n\n“No!”\n\nTamara shrieked and forcefully got her body up to where she was.\n\nShe instantly looked at her feet and tried to look around — full of bewilderment.\n\nHer temple throbbed as she sought to do that. Her sight was whirling for her hasty move. She held her aching temple with her soft palm as she tried to compose herself while her eyes were shut tightly.\n\n“I’m okay, I’m okay,” she whispered as a mantra to herself, while her other hand went up to her chest, soothing the tense crawling of her entire being.\n\nThank God!\n\nIt was just a dream.\n\n“It was just a dream, Tamara. It was just a dream,” she breathlessly whispered to herself repeatedly, trying to calm her raging nerves.\n\nShe heaved a deep sigh and opened her eyes once again. She placed down both her hands and shook her head moderately.\n\nAn abrupt realization flashed in her mind when her eyes met those blank, cold eyes in the rear-view mirror.\n\n“It’s good that you’re awake now,” he plainly commented as he moved his eyes to the road and continued maneuvering the car.\n\nYes.\n\nShe was sitting in the back seat of a moving car that led to God knows where. She looked at the window — and all she could see was darkness. Tamara’s forehead creased.\n\n“W-where are we going? W-what are you g-going to do to m-me? W-what is happening?” She nervously stammered and felt a shiver down to her back.\n\nShe couldn’t stop the questions that kept on popping up inside her mind. She was restless, and she needed someone to answer her questions this instant!\n\nAt least just to answer her — regardless of whether it was the truth or not. It was her judgment to decide whether to believe it or not.\n\nBenson let out a deep sigh as he took a quick glance at her.\n\n“Just wait, and your questions will soon be answered once we arrive at the Lunar Mansion,” Benson replied, still void of any emotions.\n\nTamara cleared her throat as she inquired.\n\n“L-Lunar Mansion?”\n\n“Yes. That is what the Lunar Pack House was called,” he simply responded as he took a swift look at her.\n\nShe was so confused but she couldn’t find her voice to ask more about what he was trying to tell her.\n\n“W-where are my p-parents? W-who are r-running after us?” Her eyes began to water again as she slowly realized why she had collapsed a while ago.\n\nShe had left her parents — she was an awful daughter for leaving them behind. She wanted to know more about what happened to them or to at least assure her that they were okay.\n\n“They were already dead, Tamara. They were killed by rogues,” Benson replied as a matter of fact.\n\nTamara’s heartbeat hitched as she heard those words and unbelievably looked at him.\n\n“Rogues? What rogues?” she unbelievably questioned.\n\nBenson’s forehead creased — the first time she saw a bit of emotion — but it immediately wiped away from his face and once again turned into a plain, stoic one.\n\n“Rogues are bad werewolves,” he said it as simple as that, as if it was just a common thing to him.\n\nTamara’s eyes widened in shock, and she tried to calm her nerves.\n\n“I-is that even possible?” she let out a nervous and low chuckle, trying to cover the sudden presentiment she felt.\n\nShe saw how Benson took a glimpse at her once again but didn’t say a word. What the hell was he talking about?\n\nRogues?\n\nWeren’t they non-existent?\n\nMaybe she was just trying to scare her, but she couldn’t take away the fact that she was with this man. She didn’t know whether he was the one her mother was talking about or not. So, still, she couldn’t trust anyone, and she needed to escape — and fast.\n\nIf she couldn’t find answers from him, she would find them on her own.\n\nA light bulb nimbled her mind as she contemplated her plan. Good thing she was wearing a black moto knit jogger and a large purple shirt — her typical style when she was sleeping.\n\n“Uhm, I-I need you to stop the car.” She tried to grimace as she looked at him.\n\nHe looked at her plainly.\n\n“I need to— uhm, nature calls.” Tamara’s face turned pale pink as she said those words.\n\nThough she was just partially acting, she was still embarrassed to say those words to a skeptical stranger.\n\n“Can’t it wait? Some of the rogues can still catch us.” Benson basically said to her, his forehead creased more.\n\nNow, she could finally see worry and irritation plastered on his face. Maybe, if they were in a different situation, she would tease him about it, though.\n\n“I can’t hold it anymore,” she dramatically stated, and she deceitfully contorted her face and aggressively clutched her stomach with both hands. Her acting was the worst, and she just knew it, but she was so desperate to escape at once.\n\nBenson swerved the car so sharply at the side of the road that she almost hit her head on the car window. Tamara rolled her eyes because of her deep irritation.\n\n“Don’t go too far and make it fast. It’s too dangerous,” he warned her as he sighed and unlocked the car door.\n\nShe just nodded her head and immediately opened the car door. She was seriously wanting to pee, but she was more eager to escape from him.\n\nShe slowly walked away while he was looking at her like a hawk at his prey.\n\nShe instantly tied the lace of her pants as she looked around. She was approximately ten meters away from Benson. Tamara peeped through the tall tree where she hid. He was out of the car, and she saw him speedily walking towards her.\n\nShe instantly trembled in fear, and she ran fast — away from him.\n\n“Tamara!”\n\nShe heard him call her name, but she didn’t even bother to look back — then a loud roar and the sound of scraping claws resonated in the depths of the forest, making the birds fly instantly.\n\nHer lips quivered and she jolted to a sudden stop, then turned around to look at Benson.\n\nHer heartbeat sped up, and she just saw the most horrific scene of her entire life — Benson was surrounded by five huge wolves that were deviously showing off their bared canines.\n\nThey all looked like they were ready to attack him in an instant.\n\nShe covered her open mouth with both hands to stifle her loud gasp. She was glued to her feet as she watched how Benson instantly twisted his body and shifted into a bulky wolf!\n\nHe was a werewolf!\n\n“Oh my God! Oh my God!” she silently whispered over and over again to herself. She was trying to keep her voice as low as possible, for she needed to let out her hyperventilating emotions.\n\nHis sleek, grayish fur gleamed brightly in the middle of darkness. He let out a loud and lengthy growl thrice.\n\nTamara shakily and gently took a step behind her, and the sound of the snapping twigs made the enormous wolves turn their heads to where she was!\n\nHer whole body started to tremble as she stared at those wicked eyes she had never seen in her life.",

        "content": "“Did Benson already find her?” The woman asked the muscular man who was standing and staring at the huge window glass from their huge mansion.\n\nShe was sitting on a single, deep, forest green sofa while sipping her favorite lemon and mint tea. She was wearing a white sundress that flowed freely, reaching her knees, which was paired with nude flat shoes.\n\nHer burgundy hair was neatly done into a messy bun. The woman had an aristocrat aura that was purely intimidating, added to by her narrowed eyes looking at the man.\n\nShe was in her late forties and undeniably still younger to look at.\n\nHe didn’t answer her question and just continued puffing his stale tobacco while looking at the moon in its state — the new moon at its darkest form.\n\n“Lorenzo,” the woman called him — pure irritation was heard in her voice, which was directly at him for not answering her question.\n\nThe man called Lorenzo let out a loud snarl and faced her — she shuddered, but she composed herself and raised her brow as she placed the teacup back down in its saucer.\n\n“Just stop it, Rania. You know, we couldn’t have her here.” Lorenzo emphasized every word and tried to make her understand his point, but his face said otherwise because it reflected his hopelessness and pure concern.\n\nRania let out a defeated sigh and roughly cleared her throat. Her desperation was getting out of her, and she couldn’t do anything to stop it.\n\nHer husband, Lorenzo, turned his back to her and faced the huge glass window once again. He was wearing a simple black shirt and dark blue denim pants that fit perfectly on his entire body. He had this abnormal muscular size — one that radiated authority and an intimidating aura. It was already given because he was no other than the Alpha of the Lunar Pack.\n\n“But the plan was now ruined, Lorenzo, and you know that. We only have one last draw left, and we needed her to execute it.” Rania reminded him as she clenched her fists tightly, turning her knuckles into paperwhite.\n\nLorenzo let out a deep sigh as he shook his head gently and remained silent, still thinking thoroughly about how to move on with their plan.\n\n“What if—”\n\nShe was about to say something when she was cut off by the huge wooden door, which suddenly banged open.\n\n“Mom, we have a problem,” their daughter, Shahara, told them with a hint of urgency in her voice.\n\nRania turned pale while her gaze darted towards Shahara. Lorenzo, on the other hand, without a hurry, put down his tobacco on the ashtray that was lying on the table lamp and looked directly at her daughter’s worried face. He might be wearing his normal reaction, but deep inside, he was full of unadulterated concern.\n\nTheir hearts beat speedily as they both looked at her — and based on their daughter’s face, who was nodding disappointedly at them, something terrible might have happened.\n\n***\n\nAt that very same time, Tamara was running as fast as she could to God knows where, ignoring every sharp branch and vine that brought painful scratches and bruises all over her entire body.\n\nAfter she witnessed how Benson turned into a freaking large wolf, as well as those wicked and fearful rogue’s eyes — her own reflexes told her to run instantly, and she immediately did. She fought her wobbling legs and gathered all her strength, for all she wanted was to escape.\n\nTo escape from everything that was happening to her that she almost couldn’t comprehend why and how. Her mind was spinning as her forehead was full of bullets of sweat that were gradually flowing down her face.\n\nShe was gasping for air and looked behind as she wiped that trail of sweat in her forehead that streamed down to her cheeks — her extensive fear turned into a raging fuel that made her move expeditiously.\n\nThank God!\n\nNo one followed her.\n\nShe stopped in her tracks for a second and took a deep breath as she placed both her hands on her knees, hunching her back.\n\nTamara consciously looked around as she was embraced by a deafening silence and the night’s darkness. The hooting of the night owl stopped and only the sound of the crickets resounded the place — wherever it was.\n\nThe gushing cold wind aided in easing down her maddening hyperventilation a while ago.\n\nShe let out another deep, breathy sigh before she continued walking in her unknown tracks when in a split second an enormous, murky wolf appeared before her!\n\nHis large and bared canines were evident as it maddeningly snarled at her — ready to attack.\n\nTamara instantly flinched as she suppressed her breath — her heartbeat sped up intensely while looking at those vicious eyes.\n\nShe could still remember this one huge wolf that surrounded Benson a while ago. He had a mix of dark brown and dirty white fur. He was the largest among those other four wolves, making it hard for her to forget. Her deadly eyes looked at her, making her breath stop for a matter of seconds, and raging chills sent down her spine.\n\nHe took a very slow-paced step towards her, leaving a deep paw mark on the muddy ground as she took one slow step behind. Her legs began to crumble, but she never looked away from the massive beast’s eyes. Tamara braced herself with both her arms, soothing herself and praying for someone to save her.\n\nHer dark brown eyes were now blurred with unshed tears. She wanted to run, but how? She might just face her dreadful death that instant if she instantaneously did so.\n\nThe huge wolf was about to attack her, and she covered her face with her arms, bracing for the sudden impact that it might’ve caused her. But then, another large wolf with auburn fur instantly jumped at his side and did a counterattack for her.\n\nIt let out a loud snarl, giving a perilous warning towards the massive wolf. Its long, sharp, and bared canines were obviously seen.\n\nTamara cringed with shock but was also amazed at the same time.\n\nThe auburn-furred wolf looked at her and slowly nodded her head, as if telling her to go while the rogue growled loudly.\n\nHer eyes watered, and she mouthed ‘thank you’ and ‘sorry’ before turning and running away.\n\nGuilt crept within her entire system while she was running madly fast. She couldn’t stay there — she just couldn’t.\n\nHer fresh tears flowed freely as she continued running to nowhere. She couldn’t even protect herself, nor had the strength to fight, but that wolf with auburn hair could. It could protect itself from whatever that bad wolf was.\n\nShe needed to run — and fast. She needed to live and find out what happened to her parents. She needed to because that was what she had promised. She needed to find out why someone would run after her. What do they need from her?\n\nShe needed to save her own life — not just for herself but to find out the truth and give justice for her parents — whatever happened to them.\n\nShe wiped away her tears through her arms as her stifling sobs filled the cold wind that was brushing her skin. She was silently praying to survive — the only thing that kept her going now.\n\nAfter hours of continuous running, the darkness was slowly dazed by the golden rays of the sun. A mix of a little black, mauve, orange, gray, and cerulean colors filled the horizon.\n\nIf she wasn’t in her forlorn state right now, she might have loved the tantalizing hues painted in the sky — like she always did.\n\nTamara roamed around and could now slightly see the place she was in.\n\nShe was still in the middle of the suffocating woods, but she finally saw a glistening river. She plopped down on her knees on the riverside and drank the running water as if it was the first time she had had it.\n\nShe was so thirsty, and her raging stomach growl, but having this clear and fresh water to drink was enough for her to gain her strength, at least.\n\nShe washed her face unconsciously, feeling the freshness and coldness of the running water to ease herself. Then, she suddenly stopped when her eyes met her mirrored self.\n\nIt reflected her messy wavy crimson red hair that tied knots to one after the other because she didn’t even have time to comb or tie it. Her dark brown almond-shaped eyes were bloodshot red like her pointed nose. There was a large black bag under her eyes. Her lips were quivering and whitish while her cheeks were full of tear stained. Her fair skin with a touch of rosiness was now paperwhite — like a ghost in a scary movie.\n\nAll in all, she was certainly a total mess.\n\nHer eyes started to water again for her unending tears, but she wiped them away just before they flowed down to her cheeks. She was really weak, and she already knew it. Yet her strong will to find answers to her questions kept her alive — she needed to, and she was determined to continue in doing so.\n\nTamara took a deep sigh as she tried to compose herself while she stared blankly at the space in front of her. She was trying to think about what she should do next.\n\n‘What now, Tamara?’ She thought as her reverie fleeted, and she was still sitting on the muddy ground at the riverside. She didn’t even mind whether she was now getting wet with the running water.\n\nTamara let out a deep sigh as she abruptly jumped a bit and dragged her in reality by a sudden loud and nasty growl — her senses heightened, and her body started to tremble again because of anxiety and fear.\n\nAnother growl followed that echoed within the woods — this time, it was a little low and weak with a hint of pain in its tone.\n\nA devious laugh trailed after that, mixed with a couple of panting and snarling.\n\nThe hair at the back of her neck stood up as she shivered just by hearing those sounds resonating through the entire depths of the forest.\n\nTamara wanted just to stay away from whatever it was, but her feet moved closer to where the sounds were coming from — uncontrollable and as if they had their own minds. She wanted to stop, but she couldn’t, as if something was telling her to go and she hated it.\n\nShe slowly walked towards the large trees covered with vines. Tamara could hear her own heartbeat hammering inside her chest, making it ache a bit.\n\nShe swallowed roughly and found herself standing in the two tall, thick trees that twisted their trunks together. It was a secluded area, and the other trees overlapped each other, creating a fence-like hedge around the shed. She immediately hid in the great bushes and wild grass.\n\nShe saw a small open lounge barn which was made of bamboo and hay. At the barn, three tall men were standing, and one was lying on the ground.\n\nThe three men were totally bulky, and they were all wearing black shirts and pants. While the man lying on the ground had nothing to cover him.\n\n“I already told you never to dare cross us, you coward jerk,” one of the bulky men clearly stated, his voice laced with anger and annoyance.\n\nOne of them — the tallest — grabbed the neck of the man lying on the ground and spit at him. Then, he let him go forcefully and kicked his stomach. The man grunted miserably and coughed with blood.\n\nShe jumped in terror and covered her mouth to stop her gasping in hopes of being quiet and never heard by any of them. She inaudibly turned around and hid herself more, embracing her body using her trembling arms.\n\nTamara saw how hideous the scene was.\n\nWould she witness someone’s death?\n\nHere?\n\nIn the middle of nowhere while she was all alone?\n\nThe rustling sound of the lofty trees enveloped the entire place as the hair at the back of her neck stood, making her shiver.",

        "content": "The loud crashing of an antique vase breaking on the floor echoed throughout the whole receiving room. Three tall and bulky men started to tremble as their eyes were laced with undeniable fear. Their heads bowed down, and their legs shook, for they knew that with one mistake, their loving life was at stake — or worse, they had to say goodbye to it.\n\n“What the hell did you say?” A woman in her late forties was holding three sharp and long daggers in her hands, asked violently as she narrowed her eyes and looked at them with pure irritation and ferocity.\n\nThe woman was sitting on the single black sofa, wearing a silky, delicate, red maxi dress that flowed down and reached the floor, emphasizing her fair skin. It was paired with red three-inch pumps.\n\nHer straight, light ash blonde hair flowed freely at her back. Her narrowed eyes were decorated with dark black mascara and black eyeliner that contoured and defined her gray eyes. Her pouty lips are covered with deep red lipstick, causing the three men to be intimidated more.\n\nThe woman screamed of high authority, class, and power, and no one could ever break loose once she unfolded her true color. She was well-known for that — indisputably wicked and ruthless.\n\nShe held her head high and raised her brow as her face laced with a sarcastic smile, waiting for an answer while playing with the daggers in her hand.\n\nThe bulky man in the blue jacket cleared his throat, trying to find his own strength and ease his trembling voice before speaking.\n\n“The lady had escaped,” he nervously answered.\n\nHis forehead was slightly damp with bullets of sweat due to his intensifying fear.\n\nIn an instant, the man who had just spoken lay down on the floor, his breathing hard and uneven, gasping for air and whimpering in pain. A pool of warm crimson red blood streamed down from his chest as he stopped breathing and lost himself from this world.\n\nThe two men who were left standing shut their eyes tightly, feeling sorry for their pack companion but unable to do anything for him at the same time.\n\n“Find. Her.”\n\nThat was just what they needed to hear, and they eagerly dismissed themselves out of the room, or else they might also meet their tragic demise at the hands of the devilish woman.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, it took a couple of minutes more before the three men in black shirts finally left the poor man on the ground. He had endured a few more kicks, making her realize that he might already be dead.\n\nThat possibility made her shiver down to her spine — her chest clenched tightly. She wouldn’t have wanted to witness any of that, for her mind was now haywire.\n\nTamara heaved a deep, slow, and inaudible sigh as she tried to calm her raging nerves.\n\nEverything she heard was the shaking trees in the woods caused by the strong wind, embracing her and sending her further chills.\n\nTamara clenched her fist tightly, finding her strength to face the barn finally.\n\nThe three men were already gone, but she wouldn’t take any chances. She observed and looked around the passive place for a matter of minutes more before completely finding the courage to step closer to the man lying on the ground — dead… or hopefully not.\n\nTamara gently walked forward — her slow-paced tracks contradicted the fast beating of her heart. She took out a long stick to defend herself if anything happened, as if it could do something for her.\n\nShe saw a small blanket resting near the barn and used it to cover the man’s nudity. Her cheeks turned red as she tried to put the blanket on him while her eyes were looking at the other side.\n\nHer forehead creased as she studied the lying man, whose face was badly beaten — almost unrecognizable at that.\n\nShe slightly shook her head, feeling sorry for the poor man.\n\nHis left eye was swollen and started to get dark circles around it. His lips were bloated a bit and had a cut at its side — his left arm had a long scratch of a claw, which she deemed the splattered blood on the ground came from.\n\nHe was quite slim, and having three men as opponents, he was definitely outnumbered.\n\n“Is he dead?” Tamara whispered to herself as she tried to reach for the man using her long wooden stick, tapping his feet to at least get any reaction from him.\n\nShe saw him whimper as he whispered inaudible words. Tamara didn’t try to move closely to him to understand what he was trying to say. Knowing that he was not dead was enough for her, for she was still shaken and uncertain about him — the only thing that was making her stay was her conscience.\n\nShe heaved a deep sigh and bit her lower lip. She was thinking of what to do next. Of course, she couldn’t bring the man wherever she wanted to go, because even though he was slimmer than an average man, he was quite tall… and he was a man she didn’t even know.\n\nTamara decided to look for any medicinal plants around to cure the man’s arm, which was continuously bleeding. She found a white cloth inside the empty barn, some arnica flowers, and river water to treat his wounds.\n\nShe couldn’t carry him to the hay, so she decided to put some hay under him instead — to at least keep him warm. She tended to his scratched arms and covered them with a white cloth.\n\nShe also found some fruits from the trees and shrubs around the barn to relieve her starving stomach.\n\nWhile eating some wild berries, something caught her eye — something that brightened as some light rays hit it. She instantly went up and moved closer to where it was — a golden tag necklace that had the word ‘Aeron’ written on it.\n\nTamara’s forehead creased as she looked at the lying man, then she shrugged. Maybe she would just give it back to him once he was already awake. And maybe he could also help her find her way home to her parents.\n\nShe heaved a sigh as she sat up and bent down the huge tree near the barn.\n\nThe sky was already filled with different hues — shades of mauve, deep orange, wine red, grey, beige — all enveloped by darkness.\n\nTime flies passed, but Tamara still couldn’t comprehend what was truly happening to her.\n\nHer mind was floating in the midst of the night. She watched how the crescent moon formed from the dark and lonely sky — she bitterly smiled. The stars glistened so brightly — the same with her eyes, which were now moistened with tears that she immediately wiped as she tried to stay strong.\n\nShe missed her parents so much that it made her realize that she needed to contemplate a plan for what to do next. But nothing came to her mind — it was null — and she heaved another deep sigh and continued watching the stars.\n\nHer eyes flew to the man, who was already sleeping soundly while she was wide awake. The swaying of the trees swayed by the wind didn’t do good on her. The owl's hooting and the birds' shrieking sounds made her flinch to the ground where she was currently sitting.\n\nTamara braced herself for the moment of deafening silence as her sobs came out painfully. She was soothing herself from the cold wind brushing her skin, making her feel so petrified and so alone.\n\n***\n\nAt the same time, in the Lunar Mansion, the Vikesh Family, who led the Lunar Pack, was settling down in the receiving area of their huge place.\n\n“I’m so sorry, Alpha Lorenzo, Luna Rania. I failed you,” Benson held his head down as Doctor Dreyson — the salutary or official herbal wolf of the Lunar Pack — treated his wounds.\n\nBenson needed to break the news to them before letting the physician take him to his barn house near the mansion.\n\nBenson, being the Beta of the Lunar Pack — headed by Alpha Lorenzo and his Luna Rania — was tasked with fetching Tamara from Winston and Ameia’s house. They learned that their enemy had already made their move to attack them, so they needed to protect Tamara — at all costs.\n\nIt was one of his vital and crucial missions, and he had failed to execute it — now, all of their plans were already crumbling down to ashes. Tamara escaped and was nowhere to be found.\n\n“It’s okay, Benson. We just hope she is safe and the Dark Wood Pack doesn’t have her either.” Rania answered firmly.\n\nHer hands were in tight, closed fists, and her jaw was clenched, trying to compose herself. Benson kept his head down a little bit more by hearing Luna’s tone of voice.\n\nRania and Lorenzo quietly stayed where they were sitting as the intense silence enveloped them. But Shahara immediately broke it by letting out a heavy sigh and clearing her throat.\n\n“I saw one of Aeron’s hunters running after her.” Shahara infuriatingly informed them.\n\nRania’s eyes widened at the sudden news while her hand flew in front of her agape mouth.\n\n“And I’m sure he is there when the attack happens. I can smell him in the air. That shameful coward,” Shahara added while gritting her teeth and nodding her head with her raised eyebrow.\n\n“Shahara,” Rania’s tender voice gave her a hint of warning.\n\nRania, being the Lunar Pack’s female leader, didn’t tolerate any ferocity and wickedness in any form — even in words — towards any person as much as possible, even if that person was one of their enemies.\n\n“Sorry,” Shahara cutely smiled at her mother and made a peace sign.\n\nRania just sighed. “Are you certain of that?” She patiently asked for her daughter’s confirmation.\n\nShahara nodded, looking directly into her mother’s eyes, who massaged her temple lightly and squeezed her eyes shut, taking in what she had just said.\n\n“I just badly hurt one of his hunters, though,” Shahara proudly said as she smirked evilly.\n\nRania snarled in protest, and Shahara just pouted.\n\nLorenzo cleared his throat. “Anyway, let’s all leave that to the moon’s fate. I have important and urgent news to announce.”\n\nAll of the eyes in the room darted to the Alpha of the Lunar Pack — Lorenzo — waiting for him to continue his words.\n\n“The king announced an urgent meeting. All members of the pack holding a high position needed to be at his castle tomorrow afternoon.” He seriously uttered.\n\nTheir eyes widened in surprise as Lorenzo, on the other hand, clenched his jaw. Their minds suddenly bombarded with diverse questions — all the same. The king abhorred gatherings in his castle, and if they needed to have a meeting, Arlan, the second-in-command, always did it in the pack meeting house just near the castle and not inside the castle.\n\n‘So, why now?’ They thought.\n\n“H-how come?” Rania curiously asked.\n\nLorenzo shook his head — even he couldn’t decipher what was in the king’s mind right now.\n\n“I just hoped it wasn’t about the ‘regina,’” Lorenzo whispered lowly, but low enough for the people there to hear him.\n\n“The Were Elders’ Council was asking him to settle down already. As if they could do something if the king didn’t want it to happen,” he added, and he laid his back on the single forest green sofa where he was sitting.\n\nAll of them now were seriously contemplating something on their mind — all were hoping it wasn’t about the ‘regina,’ but the possibility was making them more agitated.\n\n“We need to find Tamara as soon as possible.” Shahara pressed her lips together as those words escaped from her mouth.\n\nNo one contradicted her because all of them were thinking the same thing.\n\n***\n\nTamara woke up with a stiff neck and backache. It was still dark and cold. She believed she slept on the wrong side of her bed — but wait, she wasn’t on her bed, nevertheless on the ground inside the barn.\n\nShe inspected her bruises — which were swiftly healing as she tended to them, too, yesterday — while slowly walking out of the barn.\n\nShe decided to go inside to keep her warm from the icy cold gusting wind.\n\nBut her forehead creased as she stopped in her tracks and looked at where the man was lying — now, all she could see was empty hay.\n\nTamara scratched the back of her neck as she heaved a deep sigh.\n\n‘He didn’t have the guts to thank her.’ She thought as she shook her head in disappointment. Then, she suddenly remembered the golden tag necklace that she had forgotten to give the man.\n\nShe was about to look for it in her pants pocket, but before she could make a move, a glimmering, extremely large black wolf appeared in front of her, making her jump a bit in shock. She began to panic as she looked at the pair of pitch-black eyes, making her tremble in fear.\n\nOnce again, darkness consumed Tamara as she fell to the cold ground.",

        "content": "Tamara woke up with a tremendous headache — her temples throbbed in pain, and she kept her eyes shut tightly. Flashes of what had happened to her immediately woke her senses up.\n\nShe got up in an instant with wide eyes and her vision spun for her sudden move, so she instantly shut her eyes to collect herself and opened it again. She was welcomed with a stinky smell of dead rodents. Her stomach churned, and she almost gagged — she covered her nose as she looked around.\n\nShe was now sitting on the cold and filthy floor — thank God she didn’t see any rodents around making it tolerable for her, or else she would really freak out, but it still stank.\n\nShe was like in a prison cell with brick walls — well, it was more like a box with locked rustic metal bars enclosing the cage where she was jailed.\n\nJailed?!\n\nShe blinked her eyes and unbelievably stared at the metal bars.\n\nShe remembered her parents, then Benson, who had become a wolf! Chills went down her spine as she remembered that and how she was almost attacked by a huge bad wolf and was saved by an auburn furred one.\n\nTamara held her throbbing temple. Then, she tended to an unfamiliar man, who had just left without her knowing and…\n\nHer eyes widened in a mix of anxiety and fear when she remembered an extremely huge black wolf that appeared in front of her, and everything went black. Her heart hammered in terror as the hair at the back of her neck stood.\n\nShe once again looked around her, making sure that she was the only one there. She wouldn’t know what to do if a massive wolf suddenly jumped at her.\n\nShe shivered at that thought.\n\nGood thing she was the only one there.\n\nBut wasn’t it odd that she was there?\n\nWhere is she?\n\nWhat happened to her?\n\nWho sent her there?\n\nWas it the large black wolf?\n\nTamara suddenly panicked and took a swift glimpse towards her whole body and heaved a deep sigh — at least she was okay — she was alive and kicking.\n\nShe stood up with the entire length of her body trembling, and she gradually walked towards the metal bars, looking at possible people she could talk to — to at least ask for help.\n\nShe bit her lower lip to stifle her shaking nerves.\n\nThe rays of the sun from the high windows, almost touching the ceiling, made her see the unlit torches along the pathway.\n\nHer eyes glittered with hope as she looked at the guard, who was standing like a statue near the main door.\n\n“Hey! Where am I? Can you get me out? I don’t know why I’m here!” She pleaded as she tried to speak coherently.\n\nHer hands shook the metal bars as if she could break through them to at least get the guard’s attention.\n\nHowever, she didn’t get any reaction at all — not even a quick glance in her place. He was just standing like a cemented sculpture and was deaf to her pleads.\n\n“Hey!” Her voice cracked for her unshed, pathetic tears.\n\nTamara swallowed the lump in her throat as she tried to yell again — this time a little bit louder.\n\n“Don’t you hear me? I said—”\n\nBut she was clearly cut off by loud and enraged howls coming from the numerous prison cells that echoed in the entire room.\n\nShe was stunned at where she was standing. She couldn’t see what it was, but she had a tiny little clue of what it could be. Her heart beat hitched, and her eyes widened as chills crept at the hair on the back of her neck, making her shiver in so much fear.\n\nA loud and maddening snarl from the guards, who were just standing afront, made the enraging howl into weakened and frightened whimpers until it ended with a raucous silence — again.\n\nShe couldn’t move because of what she had just seen and heard. It was making her maddeningly crazy. She couldn’t comprehend what the heck had happened.\n\nA low chuckle brought her senses back, and she snapped her eyes to where it came from — a man was comfortably sitting on the floor, leaning his head at the back of his hand while his elbows were resting on his thighs. He was in the other prison, facing her and smugly looking at her. Her blood boiled in just the mere sight of him — like he was mocking her or something — and she hated it.\n\n“Don’t waste your time shouting, pup,” he conceitedly smirked at her.\n\nTamara creased her forehead as she looked at him like she was shooting daggers at him. She didn’t know him; besides, he was also in prison — he might be a ruinous, loathsome, pestilent person.\n\nUnlike her, she knew she didn’t do anything bad — well, except for leaving the auburn-furred wolf in the woods and even Benson. Well, they weren’t dead yet, right? Tamara shook her head lightly, trying to erase the depraved thoughts in her mind.\n\n“Why are you here, pup?” The man asked her with a hint of contemptuousness in his voice.\n\nShe was kind of irritated with his haughtiness and for calling her a pup — she was not a puppy, for goodness’ sake! She wanted to roll her eyes upwards, and she did!\n\nTamara pretended not to hear anything. She’d rather stay quiet than talk to this filthy man. Well, just being hypercritical — the man was wearing a huge, torn, murky, dark blue shirt and ripped, muddy, black loose jeans — he looked more like a bum beggar.\n\nHis long jet-black hair fell messily and reached his nape. He had thick brows that matched his dark gray eyes and tan skin. He wasn’t muscular — just toned.\n\n“Are you deaf, pup? Well, I heard from you a while ago. Maybe the cat got your tongue, huh? Well, I don’t think you wouldn’t have the chance to get out of here, so perhaps we can just have a little chit-chat. What do you think? Hey, pup—”\n\n“Will you please stop calling me ‘pup’! I am not a puppy.” Tamara finally said infuriatingly, stressing every single word she had just said.\n\nThe man just raised both his hands, as if surrendering to her — well, sort of — because he was still wearing his smug look anyway.\n\nTamara was about to unleash another murderous litany when the main door creaked wide open. Her eyes broadened as she saw a glimmer of hope to be finally free from this place.\n\nTwo men wearing black shirts and black denim jeans entered the jail room. Their faces were stoic and blank while walking along the pathway, holding an intimidating dark aura.\n\nOne of them was taller than the other. They almost looked the same, though — equally muscular and tanned. Their eyes were both dark amber, and they had pitch black hair.\n\nThe guard watching the main door followed them behind like they were one of the bosses there. Tamara swallowed hard as she thought that maybe they could help her out. They stopped in front of the prison cell of the arrogant man who vainly called her ‘pup.’\n\nThe conceited man crossed his arms and just gave them a plain bored look — gone were his proud looks a while ago, making her blink in confusion.\n\n“So, you’re here again.” The taller man commented as his lips curled upwards sardonically. His eyes were viciously looking at him.\n\n“It depends. Perhaps you want to think I was just a figment of your imagination, then — go on.” The man inside the cell plainly answered, making the tall man clench his jaw in annoyance.\n\nTamara just watched them with her lips slightly ajar — her eyes gaze moved from one to the other, with her brows furrowed and completely confused.\n\n“Just get him out of here, Dillion.” The other man said, crossing his arms in front of his broad chest.\n\nThe man named Dillion motioned to the guard, who immediately obliged and unlocked the cell for the conceited man to get out.\n\nThe arrogant man just made a face and shrugged, then boringly stood up. He shook off his pants as if it wasn’t already filthy as it were, and proudly walked through the aisle while one of his eyebrows raised, then stopped in front of the two men and smirked.\n\nThe two men just clenched their jaws and turned around — they didn’t want to get provoked by the crazy man and started to walk away.\n\nBefore the man in prisoned followed the two, he gave her a side glance and winked at her before he languidly turned around and started walking.\n\nShe watched him walk with mouth ajar, swallowing hard before she finally found her voice.\n\n“Wait—” she called them with a hint of panic in her tone.\n\nShe let out an inaudible gasp the moment her eyes found theirs. She slightly nibbled her bottom lip to keep herself from trembling under their intense gaze.\n\n“I… I… Uhhh…” She couldn’t find the right words to say — her mind was haywire, and the way they looked at her wasn’t helping her either.\n\nThe two authoritative men just gave her a boring look, while the arrogant man gave her an amused one. Tamara heaved a deep sigh before fighting their intense stares.\n\nShe clenched her hands, trying to stop her hammering heart beat inside her chest.\n\n“I shouldn’t be here. I don’t know why I’m here. Can you please get me out, too? I need to get out of here.” She begged like her life depended on it — her eyes started to water again.\n\nTheir forehead creased just by watching her with unshed tears — no amount of pity in their faces and as if she was just a lowly person who begged for her useless life.\n\nHer heart was clenching achingly at their minuscule stares.\n\n“I don’t know what you are saying, pup, but tomorrow is judgment day. Besides, you would not be here if you didn’t commit a grave sin. All of the prisoners will be executed tomorrow, so brace yourself.” The taller man called Dillion answered plainly, as if it was a common thing for them to say, and not about her precious life being taken away.\n\nThe conceited man just shook his head as if he was just disappointed with her.\n\nHer mouth went agape as her ears suddenly became deaf from all those words she had heard. She absentmindedly looked at the men, who were now walking away from her as if nothing had happened.\n\nThey simply left her there — alone and miserable, without a tiny hint of doubt that she might be innocent as if they were all just right in accusing her or enlightening her of her supposed-to-be sin.\n\nWhatever the heck was that!\n\nShe could even hear her own heartbeat speedily echoing in her ears as she slammed the metal bars with her bare hands.\n\n“No,” she shakingly whispered.\n\n“No! No! No!” This time, it was louder. It filled the entire room, ignoring the stinging pain in both her hands and arms as she smacked the jail bars hard and continuously.\n\n“No! Please! No!” She miserably cried.\n\nShe was undeniably desperate and scared.\n\nShe was losing hope as she felt weakened while slapping the metal bars in front of her. Fresh tears streamed down her face endlessly.\n\nTamara embraced her frail body using her bare forearms, slowly losing her faith as she collapsed gradually on the cold concrete floor.\n\nWould she not see her parents again? Would she not find justice for them? Would she not fulfill her promise to them? Would she be facing her miserable demise?\n\nHer bloodshot eyes — which were visibly deprived of sleep and complete rest — were full of tears that raced down her cheeks. Her hard pants and heartbroken sobs filled the prison cell as she covered her mouth with her cold and sweaty palm.\n\nShe feebly curled her body into a small ball as she sat and leaned on the brick walls from behind. Tamara lost sight of every light in her eyes as she closed her lids.",

That peace, was broken when the king of Mombana passed away and a new monarch, Prince Cone, took over.\n\nPrince Cone had always been hungry for power, always wanted more and more. After his coronation, he attacked Salem. The attack was so unexpected, Salem never prepared for it. They were surprised. The king and queen were killed, and they took the prince into slavery.\n\nThe people of Salem that survived the war were enslaved; their land taken from them. They made their women and some of their men into sex slaves.\n\nThey lost everything.\n\nEvil befell the land of Salem in the form of Prince Cone. The prince of Salem, Lucien, was filled with rage and swore revenge against King Cone while in slavery.\n\nTen years later, thirty-year-old Lucien and his people escaped slavery. They went into hiding and recuperated, training day and night under the leadership of the fearless and cold Prince Lucien, who was driven by the love of his people to get back their land and take Mombana’s land as well.\n\nIt took them five years before they ambushed and attacked Mombana. They killed Prince Cone and reclaimed everything.\n\nAs they screamed out their victory, Lucien’s eyes found and pinned the proud princess of Mombana: Princess Danika, the daughter of Prince Cone.\n\nAs Lucien stared at her with the coldest eyes she’d ever seen, he felt victory for the first time. He walked to the princess with the slave collar he’d worn for ten years rattling in his hand. With a swift movement, he collared her neck.\n\nHe tilted her chin up, staring at the most beautiful face ever created. Giving her a bitter smile, he stated curtly, “You are my acquisition. My slave. My sex slave. My property. I will pay you in spades—everything you and your father ever did to me and my people.”\n\nPure hatred, coldness, and victory danced in his eyes.\n\n“Strip,” he ordered, his voice cold.\n\nDanika had mentally prepared herself for this night, but being faced with it caused fear to course through her.\n\n“Please… ” she started, but snapped her mouth shut, knowing she had made a mistake.\n\nLike a panther, he stalked closer to her and yanked her hair so hard her head snapped back, and she bit her lips to keep from crying out from the pain. There was no remorse in his eyes. Only hatred so raw it chilled her.\n\n“You either strip, or I call the guards to help you.”\n\nHer hands went to the neck of her robe, and she started untying the ropes that held the clothing together. Undressed completely, she allowed the robe to fall to the ground.\n\nHer hands trembled, but she curled them into fists. Tonight, she’d lose her virginity in the cruelest way in the hands of the coldest man she has ever known.\n\nBut she’d bear it with dignity.

        "content": "A chill went down Danika’s arms. She had never seen such raw hatred in anybody’s eyes. King Lucien hated her. Danika knew the reason better than anybody. Oh, did she know.\n\nOne week ago, she was Princess Danika, daughter of King Cone of Mombana. She was feared and respected. No one dared look at her twice. No one would dare look her in the eyes. Or dare walk the path she walked unless they had no value for their life. Her father saw to that.\n\nNow, her father was dead, their kingdom taken over by the ruthless King Lucien.\n\nThe sound of footsteps and chains rattling drew Danika’s attention towards the door of the cell. The door opened, and a bodyguard entered, carrying a tray of food. Danika’s stomach rumbled, hunger coursing through her. Reminding her that this was her first meal since morning, and it suspiciously looked like evening now.\n\n“Here’s your food, Priiiincess.” The guard stretched the syllable in disgust. Everyone here hated her; and Danika knew it. She raised her chin defiantly, saying nothing. “The king will be here in a few hours. Be ready to receive him,” he announced before walking away.\n\nFear slid through her. She wasn’t ready to face her captor yet. But it had been one week, and Danika knew it was inevitable.\n\nTwo hours later, the sun had almost set when Danika heard footsteps followed by, “The king has arr—”\n\n“Do not announce me, Chad,” came the curt reply that sent chills down Danika’s arms. In all her twenty-one years of life, she never heard a voice so cold.\n\n“I apologize, my king,” Chad quickly said.\n\nSounds of chains… and then someone threw the door open. Only the king entered because Danika heard just one almost-unheard footstep. The door closed behind him.\n\nSuddenly, her cold barren cell was no longer so…barren. She raised her eyes and stared at him with her own hatred in her eyes. He was big, like a warrior, but he had the bearing of a king. Danika knew he was thirty-five years old and larger than life itself. Even when he was her father’s slave, that regality was present around him, no matter how much they had beaten him—how much they had tortured him.\n\nThey stared at each other, the malice between them apparent. Only King Lucien’s wasn’t just hate—it was loathing. Full of raw hatred and rage. There was no warmth in his eyes. His face would have been handsome, but a thick scar ran over one cheek, giving him a savage look.\n\nHe stalked closer to her, bent down, and ran his hand through her blonde—almost white—long hair, then gripped it tightly and yanked hard, forcing her head back so she had to stare into the ocean that was his eyes. Pain seared her.\n\n“When I come in here, you’ll address me. You don’t just sit like a coward staring at me, or I’ll punish you for it.” His eyes flashed red. “I would love nothing more than to punish you.”\n\nDanika nodded. Yes, she hated this man—her captor—but she had a deep aversion to pain. She didn’t like pain at all and would do anything to avoid it… if she could.\n\n“Yes… my king,”\n\nDisgust flashed in his eyes. His hand lowered and rested on her barely covered breast. He circled her nipple through her clothing, and then pinched Danika so hard she cried out as a thick wave of pain reverberated through her. He held the nub tight as he looked her in the eyes. “I am not your king, and I will never be your king. I am a king to my people, and you’re not my people. You’re my slave, Danika. My property.”\n\nDanika nodded quickly, wishing he’d let go of her hurting nipple.\n\nInstead, he twisted her nipple harder so that her eyes watered. “You will address me as your master, and you will serve me. Just like my servants… only more.” His lips curved into a savage smile filled with hatred. “Surely, you know how a slave serves her master. After all, your father taught you well.”\n\n“Yes! Yes!” she cried, curling her hands into fists. “Please, just let go!”\n\nHe pinched harder. “Yes… what?”\n\n“Yes, M-Master.” Angry tears filled her eyes. Danika hated that word more than anything because of how demeaning it was.\n\nHe let go almost immediately and backed away from her, his face devoid of any emotion. Standing up, he ripped her flimsy top to shreds, exposing her naked breasts to his cold, unfeeling eyes.\n\nTears of humiliation choked Danika’s throat. She fisted her wretched skirt to not to give in to the urge to cover herself from him.\n\nHis eyes didn’t change as he took in her body. No flash of lust. Nothing. Instead, he palmed one breast—the one with the aching, red, abused nipple—and caressed it. “Stand.”\n\nShe stood on shaky legs, staring at the ground with blurry eyes.\n\n“Chad!” he barked.\n\nShe froze and tried to get away from him to seek cover for her state of undress, but the hand that held her breast tightened, stopping her movement—unless she wanted to risk more pain.\n\n“Your Highness?” The big man entered, staring at his king.\n\n“Take a good look at this slave, Chad. Do you like what you see?”\n\nChad’s eyes caressed her body, and Danika wished the ground would open and swallow her. But she stood defiantly, staring Chad squarely in the face.\n\nLust blanketed Chad’s eyes as he looked at her hungrily. “Can I touch?”he asked eagerly. Chad stared at the king again before walking out, and Danika discovered that there was a look in the man’s eyes when he gazed at his king. Not hate—no, not hate. But she couldn’t place that look.\n\n“Guards!” the king called, but he didn’t raise his voice.\n\nTwo guards appeared. “Yes, Your Highness.”\n\nHis cold eyes didn’t leave Danika. “Tell the servants to bathe my slave once I’m done here. Get her clean and have her in my chambers in three hours.”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness.” The guards were reluctant to leave because they her nudity enraptured them.\n\nDanika focused on the king with anger and hate in her teary eyes, defiance in her stance.\n\nHe released her breast finally. “I will hurt you in ways that you will live and crave pain. I will do to you everything you and your father did to me and my people and more. I will share you with as many as I want, and I will train you to be the most obedient of dogs.”\n\nThe taste of fear was tangible on Danika’s tongue, but she didn’t allow it to show on her face. She knew all this would happen even before he came in.\n\nHis lips twitched, drawing emphasis to his scarred cheek. “I will break you, Danika.”\n\n“You can never break me, you monster!” The words tore from Danika’s lips.\n\nHer eyes widened because she talked back at him. Slaves do not talk back at their masters or there would be punishment.\n\nHe didn’t disappoint. The king grabbed the chain of Danika’s collar and yanked on it hard, and Danika cried out.\n\nHis eyes flashed. He tilted her chin up, his grip strong. “I love seeing so much fire in you because I am going to love quenching all of it. You have no idea what I have in store for you; or maybe you do. After all, you once trained slaves.”\n\nMy father trained slaves! she almost screamed at him.\n\nPure hatred dripped from the king’s bitter words. “Your training starts tonight. You will be in my bed.”\n\nHe stood and stalked out of the room like a huge, lethal panther.",

        "content": "They put her in a tub, and the maids bathed her just like the king instructed. Funny, that maids would bathe a slave. But then again, it was not surprising if the slave’s destination was the king’s bed.\n\nThree maids attended to her. One of them, the oldest named Baski, was the one in charge.\n\nThey loosened her hair and combed out the tangles, leaving it in a long, curly mess. The clothes they had her put on made Danika cringe. It was barely any clothing; she might as well be naked. A red leather skirt that barely covered her hips and a red leather top that only covered her nipples, stopping just above her belly was all she wore.\n\nThen they gave her a long robe that covered her near nudity. They sprayed fragrance on her too.\n\n“All done,” Baski announced.\n\nDanika stared at herself in the mirror, and for a moment, she saw herself like she used to be, Princess Danika.\n\n“You can go over to the king’s chambers now. It’s not advisable to keep him waiting,” Baski stated curtly.\n\nDanika said nothing. She desperately wanted to ask these people how ‘her people’ were. She hadn’t seen any of her people since they brought her to King Lucien’s palace.\n\nWere they slaves, too? Had they sold them as sex slaves? Were they shared amongst the privileged, rich families of Salem? After all, that was exactly what her father did to the people of Salem. She was worried, but she knew she had no right to be.\n\nShe had more pressing things to worry about. Like the fact that the king of Salem, who hated her with every fiber of his being, was about to take her virginity.\n\nShe stood at the entrance of his chambers, staring at the door, then hesitantly knocked.\n\n“Come in,” came the curt reply. His deep voice reverberated through her.\n\nShe opened the door and walked in. The light illuminated the room. The chambers were bathed in gold. It was the most beautiful sight she had seen, but the situation wasn’t exactly favoring Danika’s sense of exploration and appreciation. She could only stare at the massive man who occupied one side of the room. At thirty-five years old, she has never seen a man who looked more larger than life than King Lucien.\n\nWatching him as he stuck a feather into the inkwell on the table, he withdrew it and continued scribbling on the scroll before him. It was difficult to believe that this man had ever been a slave.\n\nBut he was. For ten whole years he endured unspeakable tortures at the hands of her father. Now, he was paying it back.\n\nThe king raised his head finally and stared at Danika, holding the feather, watched her blatantly. All over her, his eyes crawled over her skin like hands. Danika shivered. His eyes were cold. Pure contempt filled his features. Danika wondered if this man ever knew what it was like to smile.\n\nSlowly, the king pushed his chair back, still staring at her. “Remove the robe,” he commanded.\n\nDanika hesitated.\n\nHis eyes flashed dangerously, and he licked his lips calculatingly.\n\nDanika forced her hands to move. She pulled the robe from her body, leaving her only in her skimpy uniform.\n\nHis eyes never left her face. “Let’s get one thing straight, slave. The next time I address you and you don’t respond, well, I will take out a whip and mar your back with twenty strokes. Are we clear?”\n\nDanika’s eyes turned tormented. She hid it immediately so he wouldn’t see how affected she was.\n\n“Yes… Master,” she spoke, trying to hide her defiance. A word that was supposed to portray submission portrayed pure rebellion.\n\nIf he noticed, he said nothing. He got up and strolled around the table, then leaned against it and pinned her with cold eyes.\n\n“Strip.” One word. One command.\n\nRebellion fled with that one word. “Please,” she whispered impulsively. But she knew she had already made a mistake.\n\nLike a panther, he stalked closer to her, and it took everything in her not to step back from him.\n\nHe yanked her hair so hard, her head snapped back, and she bit her lips to keep from crying out from the pain. There was nothing like remorse in his eyes, only hatred so raw it chilled her. “You either strip or I call the guards to help you.”\n\nHer hands went to the neck of her top, and she started untying the ropes that held the clothing together. Undressed completely, she allowed the clothing to fall to the ground. She felt panic and helplessness in her situation. A question popped into her head, overwhelming her mind.\n\nShe had to ask. Even if it would cause her to be punished, she must ask this.“Why me?” she whispered.\n\nBlue, emotionless eyes met hers. His brows arched.\n\n“Why not my father? Why me?” she asked hoarsely.\n\nHe kept silent, raising his hand to caress her face. He raised her chin up. “Why me, Danika?”\n\n“I-I don’t understand.”\n\n“My father was on the throne when your father attacked us. My mother was with Nina, my pregnant little sister, and I was just twenty years old. Why did your father kill them all and take me captive?” His voice was low, deadly, and emotionless.\n\nHe had a sister who was pregnant? Tears burned the back of Danika’s eyes because this wasn’t looking any good for her.\n\n“For the past fifteen years, I asked myself that question. ‘Why me?’” he growled. “Why kill all my family and take only me to hell?”\n\nDanika was speechless. She clamped her mouth shut. She didn’t know the answer to that.\n\nCold eyes trailed her neck as she swallowed.\n\n“Do you know my greatest anger when I look at you?”\n\nDanika shook her head helplessly.\n\nHe caressed the collar on her neck—the collar that branded her. “You’re the only child he has. Why did he have to have just one child? You’re not enough for what I have in mind, Danika. You alone cannot endure my hate and anger. You alone cannot take all the demons I have to unleash.”\n\nA chill spread over Danika’s body with each sentence he bit out. Each of them emphasized feelings that had grown for years—feelings that he nurtured deep inside him.\n\nHis dead eyes finally met hers again. “You, Danika, might not be enough…but you’ll do. Now, get on the bed.”",

        "content": "Danika’s ears still rang from everything he said to her. Her eyes stung with tears. Why did her father have to do all those things? Why did he have to be addicted to gaining power?\n\nHer hands trembled as she stood naked in before him. Tonight, she’d lose her virginity in the cruelest way: in the hands of the coldest man she had ever known. But she’d bear it with dignity. She is a princess. No—she was a princess. She was born with regality and was trained to carry herself with pride and to be a proper lady.\n\nBut this was her fate now. A fate she couldn’t escape. She raised her chin and awaited his next command.\n\n“Get on to the bed. Face down. Legs spread.” There was no expression in his eyes. Just hate.\n\nShe climbed onto the bed, pressed her face into the linen and spread her legs. She closed her eyes and waited for the inevitable. Her arms trembled slightly.\n\nBeing optimistic, she tried to focus that this was the first soft bed she was lying on in a long time. She allowed the pleasure of it to wash over her.\n\nThen he grabbed her hips, his fingers bit into her flesh, and she felt the head of his phallus nudge at her opening. Her eyes snapped open at the feel of his large penis.\n\nDanika was no stranger to a man’s anatomy—she had seen a lot of naked slaves before—but she never thought one could be as big as what was pressing into her body, searching for something.\n\nHe must have found what he was looking for because he grunted his approval. As he adjusted his knees on the bed, the small pleasure she felt disappeared when he pulled back out and pushed in.\n\nShe sucked in a startled breath as his short thrusts quickly became painful, and she held her breath and waited for it to happen.\n\nBreathing hard, he held her by the hips, and when he pulled back and then pushed forward with one long, hard thrust, bottoming out inside of her, she cried out in agonizing pain, gritting her teeth until her jaw went numb.\n\nHe stilled completely, and she let out a tear-filled whimper she couldn’t control. It hurt more than she expected it would. So, so much more.\n\nHe pulled back and shoved into her again. She buried her face in the bed, and screamed, twisting her trembling body away from his brutal possession. But his powerful hands caged her, holding her body immobile. He covered her with his body and plunged into her repeatedly, the force of his thrusts pressing her unrelentingly deeper into the bed.\n\nOnly her pained cries were heard in the golden room. He made no sound. Not even a grunt.\n\nAlthough he took her fiercely like an animal, Danika would have sworn he was restraining himself. It made her wonder if he’d break her in two if he didn’t.\n\nThe fierce thrusts went on and on, then suddenly, he pulled away from her completely.\n\nDanika stilled, lying on the bed, unable to move her body. She sobbed to the bed.\n\n“Get out of my room,” he commanded, walking away without a backward glance at her. She heard the door open and close behind him with a bang.\n\nShe knew he didn’t finish, and she wondered why. The man hated her; he had no remorse for her. So why didn’t he keep plundering her body until he gained his satisfaction? She didn’t know the answer to that, and it was the least of her problems. Alone, she wept aloud. For the first time since they ambushed her kingdom, killed her father, and they took her into slavery, she felt pain. Real raw pain.\n\nHeart-wrenching sobs wracked her body. She had always dreamed of flowers. Her husband making love to her under the moonlight. Her losing her virginity to him while he loved her body tenderly.\n\nThis was nowhere near what she imagined. Reality hurt like a knife to the heart. Father, why did you have to do this to me?\n\nShe didn’t know which pain was greater: the one coming from her body or the one from her heart. The one from her body was physical. What he did to her hurt. But the one to her heart hurt too, because she knew that this was her life now.\n\nDanika got off the bed, glad that he was not around. She didn’t know what she’d do if he had to watch her trying to stagger her way out while openly crying.\n\nShe wrapped the robe around her body and left the room.\n\nBlood smeared her thighs, still dripping out from her womanhood. She made it to her cold cell, and the guard opened it. Danika entered the empty confinement, walked towards the old bunk without a mattress, and huddled on it.\n\nShe repeatedly sniffled, trying to control her tears. She didn’t want to cry anymore. She didn’t want to look broken…because she wasn’t.\n\nSurvival. She will survive this place.\n\nShe might be his slave on the outside, but inside she was still Princess Danika. He would not break her! She wouldn’t allow it. It was the only thing she had.\n\nJust then, the cell opened and Baski entered. The older woman gave her a polite smile. “The king said to extract you.”\n\nWhat? Again? “W-what?”\n\n“He said to get you out of here and—”\n\nShe lost it. “What does he want with me again!?” Danika raged, shooting up from the bed.\n\n“He wants–” Baski started.\n\n“He can go to hell for all I care! Stay away from me! Go!” the princess screamed beyond reasoning.\n\nBaski pursed her lips in displeasure but didn’t go anywhere. Instead, pity flashed in her eyes. “You really must let go of that attitude if you ever wish to make it as a slave. That was what we all did when we were trying to survive your father. That was how we survived.”\n\n“Your king is a monster!” Danika cried.\n\nBaski shook her head adamantly. “King Lucien is nowhere near the monster you think he is. You have no idea what he’s been through. You have no idea!”Baski’s eyes found hers. “He’s holding back with you.”\n\nDanika scoffed. “How can you say that? You have no idea what that monster did to—”\n\n“He’s restraining himself because if he truly wanted to give you back all your father did to him, he’d start by roasting your feminine parts,” she stated curtly.\n\n“W-what?” Danika wasn’t sure she heard the woman correctly.\n\n“Never mind.” She turned away. “If you’re done raging, you’ll hear me out. The king said to escort you to your quarters.”\n\nDanika blinked twice, wondering what was wrong with her ears. “What?”\n\n“Follow me.” Baski began walking away.\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nDanika got up with a wince and followed the woman out. The older woman escorted her to another part of the enormous palace and into a room that was small but nice-looking and tidy.\n\n“What am I doing here?” she asked the older woman.\n\n“It’s your new room.”\n\n“M-mine?” Danika stared around, wondering what these people were up to.\n\n“Clean up and go to bed. The king will request for you on the morrow.” Then Baski turned and walked away.\n\nDanika, too tired and emotionally stressed to think about anything, laid down on the bed and allowed herself to pass out. Escaping reality was always a good choice.\n\nBut what did she mean by he was holding back? And whatever the hell did she mean by him roasting out her feminine parts?",

        "content": "A knock came to the door, and King Lucien gave approval for entry. Baski entered. “I have gotten her to her room, and I have also–”\n\n“I don’t need the details, Baski. I don’t care,” he stated curtly, writing on the scroll.\n\n“Yes, Your Highness,” Baski said immediately.\n\n“How’s Remeta?”\n\nBaski’s eyes softened at the mention of her daughter. “She’s doing fine, Your Majesty. Her ears still don’t work well, but she’s doing better.”\n\nHe raised his head. “How old is she now?”\n\n“Fifteen, Your Highness.”\n\nKing Lucien lowered his head.\n\nTears burned the back of Baski’s eyes. She knew what the king was thinking because that was her thought every day. Her daughter was too young to go through what she went through in the hands of the Mombana kingdom. Remeta would never recover from that experience.\n\n“I’m glad. Send me Vetta,” he stated curtly.\n\nBaski stiffened at the mention of her name. “Should I tell her to come prepared?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Alright, Your Majesty.” She turned and left.\n\nLucien paused his writing and stared down at his very erect cock. He hadn’t been able to come with Danika, and he wasn’t surprised. It wasn’t because he didn’t want to, but because only Vetta could make him come.\n\nVetta was also a slave before—she and almost all the women in his kingdom. His relationship with Vetta started right there in hell.\n\nDanika had Lucien wired, and he needed the relief that came from sex. He was no longer a normal man. Cone made sure of that. Lucien could no longer achieve satisfaction like a normal man. He stared down at his scarred, painful erection. Long scars lined it, wounds from long ago that fried the veins of his phallus.\n\nThey fried his manhood so that most of the nerves there were no longer working right.\n\nLucien had to put a lot more effort into achieving satisfaction during sex, and he must achieve that satisfaction once he was erect because the more he swelled, the more his scars stretched, the more pain he felt. He had to work for it before he could feel pleasure while coupling… had to be extra rough and do other things…\n\nOnly Vetta could take him while he was this way.\n\nWhile he hated Danika with every bone in his body, he wasn’t ready to unleash himself on her yet, not on her first night here, because he would damage her beyond repair, even if it really tempted him to do that.\n\nNo, he didn’t want to kill her. Death had no part in the plans he had for her… at least not yet.\n\nHe closed his eyes. That was the most painful thing he had ever endured at the hands of Cone. The one he could never forget.\n\nHe growled in rage. How could he ever forget when he received the scars?\n\nDanika. More hatred washed over him at the very thought of her.\n\nHer blonde hair that used to be so dirty was now clean, long, and shiny—not to mention wavy. A face that used to be dirty was well groomed, and she wore very light makeup.\n\nInstead of a slave cloth, Vetta wore an exquisite red ball gown as she marched in.\n\nLucien heard from other women that Vetta could be a first-class bitch, and she even behaved like a queen, like she owned him. All the rumors were unfounded, however, because Vetta had never behaved out of sorts with him. She only oversaw his pleasure. His dark needs.\n\n“Not the bed,” Lucien commanded as she started walking towards it.\n\nVetta stared at the unsmiling, immense man with a mean scar running down his face. She smiled. “Yes, my king.”She walked towards the table and leaned against it, waiting for him.\n\nHe got up and walked towards her in silence. Vetta smiled to herself when she saw his erect organ. She’d heard of the new slave, the former Princess Danika. Apparently, even the new slave couldn’t give Lucien what he needed. Vetta smiled to herself; she’d been worried for nothing. She alone owned King Lucien. It was a heady feeling, owning a powerful man like him.\n\nHe reached close and pulled her around to face the table and give him her back. He’s always been a ‘no preamble’ person, and that was why he’d always sent for her to come prepared. The king exposed her naked flesh by raising her gown, bunching it on her waist. He shoved two fingers into her.\n\nShe was wet and slick. He grunted his approval. In one swift movement, he shoved his hot cock into her from behind forcefully, grunting inaudibly.\n\nVetta bit her lips and winced as he pummeled her body. He grabbed her hair and yanked on it as he began thrusting his big dick into her. She moaned; pleasure and pain mixed and became one. The table rattled with the force of his animalistic thrusts. He unleashed himself on her, taking her in powerful rough thrusts that both hurt and gave great pleasure.\n\nHe snaked his hands forward and grabbed her breasts, pinching her nipples hard. The force of his thrusts drew on them. Her moans filled the air. He slapped a breast hard.\n\n“Yes, yes!” she cried out.\n\nHer moans, his grunts, the slap of skin hitting skin, and the fierce rattle of the table were the only sounds in the room.\n\nThen he pulled out of her, spread her ass cheeks, and worked himself deep inside her with a groan. Vetta erupted with a scream as he pounded her ass, clawing on the table while her body sprawled rhythmically, her hair falling all over the place.\n\nShe felt his weight on her from behind as he leaned closer, changed the angle of his thrusts, and then started a short, hard, fast plunge. He went on and on. Vetta relaxed against him, taking it all—the pleasure and the pain. When he snaked his hand in front of her and slapped her clit, she gave a long moan, dangerously close to another orgasm.\n\nHe yanked on her hair so hard he rippled a few strands out, gripping it in his fierce hold as he plunged in and out of her ass. The action pushed her over the edge, the pain something her body always craved after the only thing her body knew for years and years. As she jerked beneath him, he finally followed with his hoarse groan as he came.\n\nA full minute later, he tugged himself back into his pants and faced the bathroom. “Get out.”\n\n“B-but, my king…”\n\nHer hoarse voice stopped him. Vetta always knew how to play her cards, especially after wild couplings. “What is it?”\n\nShe arranged her clothes, mentally preparing the request. “The new slave.”\n\nHis eyes darkened. “What about her?”\n\nShe couldn’t wait to have a session with the daughter of Prince Cone. After being a slave for three years before their escape, Vetta craved revenge, too. Fuck, the craving was enough to give her body another orgasm.\n\n“Can I get a session with her?” she asked, demurely.\n\n“Why do you want to?” He arched his brow.\n\n“Well, she’s your new slave, and I’m your mistress. I wanna get acquainted with her. No heavy stuff, I promise,” she lied.\n\nHe nodded curtly in reluctant agreement and headed for the bathroom. “Get out of my room.”\n\nVetta watched him disappear through the doors. I’ve never spent a night in this room in all the five years I’ve been his mistress, she thought with a pout.\n\nShe arranged her clothes and headed out of the room. Well, one step at a time. All in due time.",

They took her to the slave mines early, which were mostly where slaves worked day and night, helping to extract valuable minerals from the ground.\n\nDanika saw none of her people as she walked, only the low-born of Salem. What did the king do with the people of Mombana? she asked herself again.\n\nWhen she started down the route to the mines, all eyes were on her. Even in a slave uniform, she looked like royalty. That regalia and pride surrounded her. She walked like the lady they trained her to be, her stance screaming royalty. She didn’t do it intentionally. Royalty was in her blood, just like the king’s, even when he was still a slave.\n\nIf not for the slave uniform, slaves would have bowed to her as she passed, mistaking her for a lady from a privileged family. But once they see the slave uniform, their hate for her became apparent. They hated",

Princess Danika also helped. She kept stealing the princess’s food until the princess found out one day. The princess didn’t punish her. Instead, she helped her steal food, too. She ordered a lot of food to her own chambers just for her to pack them and go give them to the slaves. Sometimes, the princess would sneak to the kitchen with Sally, and when they were caught, she’d order the guards away and threaten them. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn’t.\n\nThe princess’s father had once punished Danika with house arrest for one entire week because the guards reported seeing them in the kitchen. One week of not coming outside or seeing daylight. The king had wanted to whip Sally, but the princess had refused adamantly and cried to her father, saying that they should whip them both if he truly wanted to whip Sally.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this book?\n\nCreate an account to unlock this chapter",

        "content": "True Luna: Rejected by My Mate (The White Wolf Series Book 1)\n\nWhen Emma turns 18, she is surprised that her mate is the Alpha of her pack. But her happiness about finding her mate didn't last long. Her mate rejected her for a stronger she-wolf. That she-wolf hates Emma and wants to get rid of her, but that isn't the only thing Emma has to deal with. Emma finds out that she is not an ordinary wolf and that there are people who want to use her. They are dangerous. They will do everything to get what they want.\n\nWhat will Emma do? Will her mate regret rejecting her? Will her mate save her from the people around them?\n\n***\n\nEmma’s POV\n\nI woke up early in the morning and got up right away. I was excited—really, really excited. Tomorrow is my birthday. Tomorrow, I will be eighteen, and I will meet my wolf. I couldn’t wait to shift for the first time. They say it’s painful, but I didn’t care about that part. It lasts only for a little while, and it gets easier later. I can survive a little bit of pain.\n\nI just wished my parents were here to see me shift for the first time. It had been eight years since they died, and it hadn’t gotten any easier.\n\nThey were killed in a rogue attack.\n\nRogues are wolves that don’t belong to a pack. They become rogues after being exiled from their packs for committing various crimes. Some choose to leave their packs and live as rogues, though that is rare. We wolves are pack animals—we don’t like being alone. When a wolf chooses to become a rogue, it’s usually because something terrible happened to them in their pack, or they lost their mate, went crazy, and left.\n\nRogues usually live alone and don’t work with other wolves. But when they attacked our pack, they were working together. It was very odd. Since that night, our Alpha learned that a rogue wolf had gathered other rogues to attack various packs. They call him the Rogue King. The attacks haven’t stopped since. They have attacked our pack and others multiple times.\n\nOn the night of the attack, the rogues tried to kill our Alpha’s son. We were celebrating his 18th birthday and his first shift. He was supposed to start training to become the new Alpha and take over the pack.\n\nHowever, that night, the rogues killed his father, our former Alpha, Luke. He was forced to become Alpha right away—and he did an amazing job. He finished his training early and made our pack one of the strongest.\n\nMy father was Alpha Luke’s Beta. He and my mom died protecting the Alpha, Luna, and their son. That was their duty.\n\nAfter their deaths, my brother Andrew became Beta. He and our Alpha had been best friends since childhood, and now they run our pack together.\n\nMy brother is an amazing Beta—and an even better brother. He was seventeen when our parents died, and after that, he had to take care of our pack and me. He never complained. He took on those responsibilities and did the best he could—and he did great. He always made sure I was safe and taken care of. He still does.\n\nI finished high school a few months ago, and now all I have to do is train. After the attacks, my brother and our Alpha decided that all pack members must train to be able to defend themselves.\n\nThe rule in our pack is that we all must go through high school. It’s similar to a human high school, but we also learn about werewolf history, pack laws, and everything needed to help the pack function properly. For example, if a wolf is interested in working for the Alpha, they will learn more about running the pack. If a wolf is interested in agriculture, they will study plants and our crops to help sustain our food supplies. If a wolf wants to defend the pack, they will learn defense techniques and attack formations and spend more time training than the rest of us.\n\nI chose to help the Alpha run our pack. It came naturally to me. My brother is the Beta, and I wanted to help him as much as I could. So, I learned all about pack laws and everything else needed to run our pack successfully.\n\nThe Alpha, Beta, and pack healer are the only ones who leave the pack to train for their positions. They travel to different packs to learn everything necessary for their roles. The training usually lasts about a year.\n\nSince our pack was attacked and our former Alpha was killed, our new Alpha and Beta finished their training in just a few months. The pack needed them, and it had to be done faster than usual. I missed my brother when he left, but I knew it was something he had to do.\n\nWe have to train every day, but tomorrow, I get a day off because it’s my birthday and my first shift—a special occasion. The first shift is important because it’s when you meet your wolf—and your mate.\n\nMates are essential in wolf culture. A mate is your fated partner, chosen by our Moon Goddess. It’s the connection of two souls. Your mate becomes the most important person in your life. You love them instantly. You want and need to be with them, to protect them.\n\nMy brother still hasn’t found his mate. Neither has our Alpha. Until he does, his mother, Gloria, still holds the Luna title and performs the Luna duties.\n\nShe had a hard time after her mate, our former Alpha, passed away. She almost didn’t make it—she stopped eating, sleeping, and doing anything at all. That’s what happens when you lose your mate—your will to live disappears. However, she recovered, and she is an amazing Luna.\n\nI love her a lot. She helped me and my brother after our parents died, and we share a special bond. She is like a mother to me.\n\nI asked her to be present for my first shift. She accepted and gave me a big hug. It’s a big deal to witness a wolf’s first shift—at least in our pack. Each pack has its own traditions, but in ours, only the wolves you choose get to see it. It’s an honor to be chosen.\n\nI chose my brother, Luna Gloria, and my friends Amy and Jacob. They were all honored and excited for me.\n\nI couldn’t wait to shift. It was going to be amazing. And maybe, I would be luckier than my brother and meet my mate soon.\n\nI had to get to training soon, so I brushed my teeth, took a quick shower, and got dressed. I put on my black tights, training bra, gray hoodie, and black Nike sneakers. Then, I tied my long brown hair into a ponytail and went downstairs.",

        "content": "Emma’s POV\n\nI was unpleasantly surprised when I came downstairs. Sienna was standing in my kitchen, looking at me like she wanted to kill me.\n\nShe was my brother’s and Alpha’s best friend. She was 25, just like them, and she had been hanging out with them since childhood. Now, she was clinging to them like they were a lifeboat. She had been devastated when she found out that neither my brother nor Alpha was her mate. That didn’t stop her from trying to become Luna. She was always around Alpha, proving herself and trying to convince him to take her as his chosen mate.\n\nWerewolves can do that. If their mate dies or they don’t find their true mate, they can take a chosen one. It’s frowned upon, especially in our pack, because we take mates very seriously. Most packs do, actually, but some have a milder attitude toward chosen mates.\n\nSienna was tall, blonde, and perfect. Her makeup was always on point. Her hair was always combed and styled to perfection. But she ruined all of that with the way she behaved. She was bitchy, mean, and disrespectful. She hated me and treated me like I was trash—but only when we were alone. When we were around my brother or Alpha, she was a totally different person. She was nice to me, and she once told my brother that I was like a little sister to her. Yuck. I tried telling my brother about her, but he didn’t believe me. He told me I was jealous of her and how much time they spent together.\n\n“Sienna,” I said coldly and grabbed a mug from the cupboard.\n\n“Good morning, ugly,” she said with a smirk. “It must be nice to sleep as long as you do.”\n\n“Maybe you should try it too,” I said as I poured coffee into my mug. “You need as much beauty sleep as you can get.”\n\nI turned toward her with a smirk on my face. She was pissed.\n\n“You little bitch,” she said through gritted teeth. “I will become Luna soon, and I will exile you so fast you won’t even have time to blink.”\n\nShe always did this—she threatened to exile me once she became Luna. I knew she actually would, and I could only hope she never got the chance.\n\nI wanted to say something back, but I heard the front door open. My brother and our Alpha walked into the kitchen. Sienna quickly put on the biggest fake smile I had ever seen.\n\nI rolled my eyes. How did nobody see how fake she was?\n\n“Good morning, little one,” my brother said, kissing my forehead.\n\nThat was his favorite nickname for me. I was small—smaller than any wolf my age—and he liked to point that out. Especially because he was huge. Six-foot-four, with muscles all over his body, just like Alpha.\n\nWe looked a lot alike. We both had brown hair and bright blue eyes. He was more tanned than me, though. I had inherited my mom’s pale complexion. I was out in the sun all the time, but I never seemed to tan.\n\n“Good morning, Andrew. Good morning, Logan,” I said with a smile.\n\nI was allowed to call Alpha by his first name only in the privacy of our homes. In any other setting, I had to refer to him as Alpha—or Alpha Logan.\n\nSienna didn’t like that. She gave me an I will kill you look over their shoulders.\n\n“Good morning, Emma,” Logan said as he sat at our kitchen table.\n\n“What are your plans today, Em?” Andrew asked as he poured coffee for himself and Logan.\n\n“Nothing much,” I responded. “I have a training session in an hour, and then I’ll just hang out with Amy and Jacob.”\n\n“Tomorrow is your first shift. Are you excited?” Logan asked, taking the coffee mug from my brother.\n\n“Yes,” I said, smiling brightly. “I can’t wait to meet my wolf.”\n\n“Maybe you’ll find your mate, Emma,” Sienna said coldly. “And maybe we’ll lose you to him tomorrow.”\n\nShe gave my brother a fake, sad look. Goddess, they were so blind if they didn’t see through her act.\n\n“Don’t worry, Sienna,” my brother said. “She will always be our little sister. No mate will take that away from us.”\n\nI wanted to scream and throw up. She was not my sister! She was a fake bitch who couldn’t wait to get rid of me! But I couldn’t say anything, so I just forced a smile.\n\n“After your shift, you can start working at the pack house,” Logan said. “You went to high school to work in the pack office, right?”\n\n“I did,” I said, smiling. “I can’t wait to start working.”\n\n“Good,” Logan said with a nod.\n\nHe was handsome—even more so when he smiled. And that was rare. He was usually very serious, focused only on his duties as Alpha. He always did what was best for the pack. That’s why he was so successful.\n\nHe was as tall and muscular as my brother—maybe even more. The Alpha and Beta of a pack were always the strongest wolves, and it showed. You could always tell who the Alpha and Beta were. He had dark blonde hair and green eyes. His jaw and nose were chiseled perfectly, and his lips looked soft. He was hot. No wonder Sienna was all over him.\n\nShe drooled over my brother as well, but being the Beta’s mate wasn’t good enough for her. Although, if my brother took her as his chosen mate, she would accept it. She was only after the title and power.\n\nToo bad they couldn’t see that.\n\nThe doorbell interrupted my thoughts.\n\nJacob was here.",

        "content": "Emma’s POV\n\n“Is that Jacob?” my brother asked.\n\nI nodded and put the mug in the dishwasher.\n\n“I’ll see you tonight. Goodbye, Logan. Sienna,” I said and gave my brother a kiss on the cheek.\n\nLogan smiled at me, and Sienna gave me a cold stare. Bitch.\n\nI walked out of the kitchen and opened the front door. My friend Jacob was standing there, smiling at me.\n\nI always had a crush on him. I still do. He is handsome, tall, muscular, and has black hair. His dark brown eyes look like pools of chocolate. And I love chocolate. Sometimes, I wish he would be my mate. We would be great together, and I know he likes me. He told me himself.\n\nWe never dated or even talked about it. We saved ourselves for our mates. It isn’t forbidden to have sex with others, but it is frowned upon—mostly by our pack elders. The rest of the pack agrees that we should wait for our mates but turns away when they see someone dating outside of a mate bond.\n\nNot all of us saved ourselves for our mates, though. I know for a fact that my brother and Logan had their share of she-wolves. I think Logan even slept with Sienna, which only added to her belief that she would be his Luna. Jake and I never talked about it, but I think he slept with some she-wolves as well.\n\nJacob is 22, but he still hasn’t found his mate. So maybe he is mine, and I am his. I won’t be happy to know that he slept around if he’s my mate, but I don’t want to hold his past against him.\n\n“Good morning, beautiful,” he said and gave me a kiss on the cheek.\n\n“Morning, Jake,” I said and closed the front door.\n\n“Are you excited?” he asked, taking my hand in his.\n\n“Yes, I am,” I said with a big smile. “I can’t wait to shift.”\n\n“It will be amazing,” he said. “You will be amazing. I’m really honored that you asked me to be there.”\n\n“Of course I did,” I said. “You and Amy are my best friends. I want you there.”\n\n“Maybe I’ll be something else to you as well,” he said and winked.\n\nI laughed. “Maybe you will.”\n\nWe walked over to the training grounds together.\n\nAmy was already there, waiting for us. She was a year older than me, and we met in high school. She introduced me to Jacob. They are cousins.\n\nShe and Jacob look a lot alike. She has the same black hair as he does. Her eyes are a little lighter than his, though.\n\n“Well, if it isn’t my two favorite wolves,” she said and smiled brightly.\n\n“Hello, Amy,” Jake said and gave her a kiss on the cheek.\n\nShe gave me a big hug. “I can’t wait to meet your wolf tomorrow, Emmy. Our wolves will be best friends; I just know it. Just like we are.”\n\n“Oh, I’m sure Alora will love my wolf,” I said with a huge grin.\n\nOur wolves have their own names. Amy’s wolf is named Alora, and Jake’s is named Jared. I can’t wait to learn my wolf’s name.\n\n“Enough chitchatting, girls. Time to train. I’ll see you later,” Jake said and walked over to his training ground.\n\nJacob works as a patrol wolf, so he trains harder and differently than us. Patrol wolves train separately from the rest of us. Amy works at a greenhouse. She is amazing with plants.\n\nJacob and I sometimes trained together. He taught me a little bit about what they do at their training sessions. He said he wanted me to know as much as possible so I’d be able to defend myself. He wanted me safe.\n\nAfter an hour and a half, we were done with our daily training session. Jake still had an hour left, so Amy and I went home to shower and change.\n\nWe would meet at a diner we always went to.\n\nWhen I came home, Andrew was not there. He was out dealing with pack stuff. Being a Beta isn’t like other jobs where you work from nine to five. There’s always something to do—especially when your Alpha is Logan.\n\nI quickly showered and changed into a pair of jeans, a white sweater, and my black Converse sneakers. I dried my hair and let it fall down to my waist.\n\nWhen I arrived at the diner, Amy was already sitting at our usual booth.\n\n“Hey, lady,” she said. “You look amazing.”\n\n“Thank you,” I smiled. “Not as amazing as you do.”\n\nShe was gorgeous—tall and skinny but with curves in all the right places, and totally confident. All the boys wanted her.\n\n“So, tomorrow is a big day,” she said, sipping her chocolate milkshake.\n\n“Yes. I’m so excited.”\n\n“Maybe Jake will be your mate, and we’ll be family,” she said with a big smile.\n\n“I would love that,” I said. “You know I love Jake. He would be a great mate.”\n\n“And he is totally in love with you,” she laughed. “Most boys are, actually.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” I asked, frowning.\n\nThe waitress brought me my strawberry milkshake, and I thanked her before taking a sip. It was amazing.\n\n“Come on, Emma,” Amy said, rolling her eyes. “You are beautiful and hot. I can’t believe you never noticed the looks you’re getting. It makes Jake totally jealous.”\n\n“I always thought they were looking at you,” I said and smirked.\n\nAmy laughed. “Well, they do. But I’m not the only one they’re looking at.”\n\nI blushed and looked down at my hands. “Well, I don’t care. I will wait for my mate.”\n\n“And here he comes,” Amy said, pointing at the door.\n\nJake was walking in. He gave us a big smile and walked over to our booth. He sat down beside me and kissed my cheek.\n\n“Hey, girls. What are we talking about?” he asked.\n\n“Mates,” Amy said with a huge grin.\n\n“I can’t wait to revisit that topic tomorrow,” Jake said and winked at me.\n\nI laughed and blushed. “Okay, stop making me blush.”\n\nJake laughed and pinched my cheek. “Why? There’s no prettier sight.”\n\n“Okay, love birds. Enough,” Amy said, laughing. “Emma, when are we meeting tomorrow?”\n\n“Well, I’ll have lunch with my brother and spend the day with him, and we’ll meet at the shift site at 8 p.m.,” I said.\n\nMy brother and I have a tradition of spending our birthdays together. No other people. Just him and me. We always have breakfast and lunch together. After that, we watch a movie and eat as much cake as we can. I love our tradition.\n\n“Great. I can’t wait to see if your wolf will be as small as you,” Amy said and laughed.\n\nJake joined her as I glared at them. “You bitches.”\n\n“Oh, come on, Emmy,” Jake said, laughing. “We love how small you are.”\n\nI frowned but eventually joined in their laughter.\n\nWe spent the rest of the day talking, laughing, and making plans for our first run together.\n\nIt was late when I came home, but Andrew was still out. I quickly showered, put on my pajamas, and got under my covers.\n\nI couldn’t wait to see what was to come tomorrow.",

        "content": "Emma’s POV\n\n‘Good morning, Emma.’\n\nI turned toward the door to greet my brother, but nobody was standing there. I was alone. But whose voice was that?\n\n‘It’s me, silly. Your wolf.’\n\nI flinched. Of course, it was my birthday. I got my wolf today. It was weird, though, to hear a voice inside my head.\n\n‘You’ll get used to it,’ the voice said.\n\n‘It will take some time,’ I responded.\n\n‘We have all the time in the world,’ my wolf said.\n\n‘What’s your name?’ I asked her.\n\n‘Eliza.’\n\n‘I like it,’ I told her.\n\n‘I know you do, Emma. Now, get up and go spend the day with your brother. Asher has already sensed my presence, and he can’t wait to meet me,’ she said.\n\nI got up, excited and full of energy. I couldn’t wait to see Eliza.\n\nI brushed my teeth, showered, and put on sweats and a hoodie—perfect for a lazy birthday day with my brother.\n\nWhen I came downstairs, Andrew had already made pancakes. It was our traditional birthday breakfast.\n\n“Happy birthday, Emma!” he yelled and gave me a big hug. “Asher sensed Eliza. He’s so excited to finally meet his sister.”\n\n“She can’t wait to meet him, too,” I said, giving him a big smile.\n\nI adored Asher. He was the best wolf there was.\n\n“Come on, let’s eat,” he said, pulling me to the table.\n\nAfter we were full, we went to the living room to start our first movie of the day. We always watched the Avengers series. Humans did a great job on those movies.\n\nAt around 1 p.m., Andrew and I went to the kitchen to start making lunch. On my birthday, we always had my favorite meal—lasagna. On his birthday, we had his favorite meal—pizza.\n\nI started making the lasagna while Andrew sat at the kitchen table.\n\n“Maybe you’ll find your mate soon,” he said.\n\n“Maybe,” I said, not looking up at him.\n\nI didn’t like talking to him about this. He was my brother, and talking about mating was weird. And I didn’t want to leave him. Ever. It would be really hard for me to leave with my mate.\n\n“Maybe it will be Jacob,” he said.\n\nI looked up at him. “Would you be okay with that?”\n\n“Yes,” he said with a shrug. “He’s one of our best warriors, so I know you’d be safe with him. And I know you already like him. It would be easier for you to go with him.”\n\nI walked over and sat beside him. “It won’t be easy for me to leave, no matter who my mate is. You’re my family. I don’t want to leave you.”\n\n“I know, Em,” he said, smiling. “I don’t want you to leave either. But if you find your mate, you will. And we’ll be okay.”\n\n“Maybe I won’t find him,” I said, getting back up. “You never did.”\n\n“Yes,” he nodded. “But I have a pretty good feeling you will. And it will be Jacob.”\n\nI smiled and rolled my eyes. “We’ll see.”\n\nHe got up and helped me finish our lunch. After we ate, we went back to the living room to watch another movie.\n\nAt around 7 p.m., Andrew told me to go and get ready. We had to walk for about 20 minutes to reach the shifting site in the forest.\n\nIt was a small clearing in the middle of the forest where all wolves went for their first shift. It was special because it was the only place in the forest where the moon could shine on you completely. Our forest was so thick that the moon barely shone through the trees. The clearing was the only place it shone freely.\n\nI put on my white dress, chosen especially for this night. It was tradition to wear white on the night of our first shift. I put on my shoes and went back downstairs.\n\nAndrew was waiting for me at the door. He handed me my jacket, and we left the house.\n\nMy heart was pounding in my chest. Andrew probably heard it because he grabbed my hand and pulled me closer to him.\n\n“Don’t be scared, Emma,” he said quietly. “It will be amazing. And I’ll be there for you.”\n\n“Thank you,” I said. “I love you.”\n\n“I love you too, little one,” he said, giving me a side hug.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we arrived at the clearing. My friends and Luna Gloria were already there, waiting for us.\n\nLuna approached me first. “Happy birthday, sweetie. I can’t wait to meet your wolf.”\n\n“Thank you, Aunt Gloria. She’s excited to meet you, too,” I said with a big smile.\n\nAmy and Jacob came toward me with big smiles on their faces.\n\n“Happy birthday, Emmy,” Amy said, giving me a tight hug.\n\n“Happy birthday, Emma,” Jake said and kissed my cheek. “Now, let’s meet your wolf. It’s cold, and I don’t want you to get sick.”\n\nHe was right. It was December, and the only thing I was wearing was a dress. I did have a jacket, but it wasn’t keeping me warm. The only reason I wasn’t shivering was excitement.\n\n“He’s right, Emma,” Andrew said. “Give me your jacket and stand in the middle of the clearing.”\n\nI did what he said and stood in the middle of the clearing. They all gave me an encouraging smile and turned around to give me some privacy to remove my clothes.\n\nI carefully removed my dress, underwear, and shoes and folded them neatly into a pile. I stood back up and looked at the moon.\n\n‘Are you ready, Emma?’ my wolf asked.\n\n‘I am,’ I responded. ‘How do I do this?’\n\n‘Just let go. It will hurt but don’t fight it. It will be over soon. Let go and give me control,’ she said.\n\nI did what she said. I took a deep breath and let her take control of our mind and body. I started to feel my bones break. I let out a little scream and fell to my knees.\n\n“That’s right, Em,” I heard my brother’s voice. “It will be okay. Just let go.”\n\nThe pain was unbearable. It was like breaking all of my bones at the same time.\n\nI fought the urge to throw up and focused on letting go of my control.",

        "content": "Emma’s POV\n\nA few moments later, I was standing on all fours, my white fur shimmering under the moonlight. I took a deep breath and lifted my head proudly.\n\nMy friends and family turned around and gasped.\n\n“She is white,” Luna Gloria said.\n\nI looked at her and cocked my wolf head. Is that something special?\n\n‘We are a pure white wolf, Emma. Nobody is a pure white wolf,’ Eliza said.\n\n‘What do you mean?’ I asked her. ‘There are white wolves. I have seen them before.’\n\n‘Yes, but none of them are pure white,’ she said proudly. ‘They all have a spot in a different color, or their paws are different. We are all white.’\n\n“What does that mean?” Amy asked quietly.\n\n“I don’t know,” my brother said, not taking his eyes off my wolf. “But she is beautiful.”\n\n“She is,” Jacob said quietly.\n\nI looked at him and immediately felt disappointed. No sparks. No connection. He was not my mate.\n\n‘We are not his,’ Eliza said. ‘We belong to somebody else.’\n\n‘What do you mean, Eliza?’ I asked, surprised. ‘Do you know who our mate is?’\n\n‘I do,’ she said. ‘You will know soon.’\n\n‘Who is he?’ I asked. ‘How do you know?’\n\nIt wasn’t common for a wolf to know who their mate was before seeing them. What was going on?\n\n‘I am not talking to you about it,’ Eliza said. ‘Now, stop thinking about this and focus on your friends and family. Andrew is trying to mind-link you.’\n\nI pulled my focus away from our conversation and tuned into my brother’s voice inside my head. Now that I had shifted, I could mind-link the entire pack.\n\n‘Emma?’ he called. ‘Emma, can you hear me?’\n\n‘Yes,’ I responded. ‘Sorry, I was talking to Eliza.’\n\n‘You are beautiful, Emma,’ he said proudly. ‘Do you want to go for a run?’\n\n‘Yes!’ I said, excitement filling my voice.\n\nMy brother told the rest of the group to shift, and we all went for a run. Eliza met all the wolves, and I could tell she loved them. And they loved her—especially Asher. He was attentive and careful with Eliza, just like Andrew was with me.\n\nWhen I had enough, I mind-linked Andrew to tell him I wanted to go back. All the excitement and nervousness had gotten to me, and I was tired.\n\nWe returned to the clearing and picked up our clothes in our mouths. We all went behind a tree to shift and change.\n\nShifting back hurt as well, but not like the first time.\n\n‘Each time we do this, it will be easier,’ Eliza said. ‘After a while, it won’t hurt at all.’\n\nI walked back to the clearing, where my friends and family were already waiting. They hugged me and gave me a lot of kisses. They were proud of me and happy that I finally had my wolf.\n\nNobody mentioned that I was a pure white wolf again, so I decided to forget about it.\n\nIt’s nothing special. I’m nothing special.\n\nLuna Gloria left first. We stayed at the clearing for a while, just chatting and laughing. After a few minutes, we started walking back.\n\nJacob walked beside me while Andrew and Amy were in front of us.\n\n“So, we’re not mates,” he said, sadness lacing his voice.\n\n“I guess not,” I responded, not looking up at him.\n\n“That doesn’t mean we can’t be,” he said. “I would choose you as my mate. I love you, Emma.”\n\nI looked up at him, surprised. But before I could say anything, my brother interfered.\n\n“Jacob, no,” he said strictly. “At least not yet. I know you love my sister, but she’s only 18, and there’s a chance she will meet her true mate. If she doesn’t in a few years, and if you don’t find your mate by then, you can make her your chosen mate—if she wants to. But not before she has had a chance to find her true mate.”\n\nI looked between Andrew and Jacob.\n\nJacob wanted to argue, but he knew my brother was right. I loved Jake, but I deserved a chance to find my true mate.\n\nAfter a few seconds of Andrew and Jake glaring at each other, Jacob finally nodded and lowered his head.\n\n“You’re right,” he said quietly. “But I will wait for her.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Jake,” I said, taking his hand in mine.\n\n“You have nothing to be sorry about,” he said and gave me a small smile.\n\nAmy had been quiet the whole time, but I could tell she was sad. She had really hoped Jake and I would be mates.\n\nWe continued our walk through the forest, and soon, we were back at our house. Jake and Amy said their goodbyes and went home.\n\nAndrew and I went inside, and I checked my watch. It was 10 p.m.\n\n“Hey, do you want to watch another movie? It’s not too late,” Andrew asked, taking my jacket to put it away.\n\n“I would, but I’m so tired,” I said.\n\nHe smiled. “Yeah. The first shift will do that to you.”\n\n“I’ll just go to bed,” I said. “Thank you for today. I loved it.”\n\n“I loved it too, little one,” he said with a big smile. “Asher and I love your wolf.”\n\n“We love you too,” I said and smiled.\n\nI walked upstairs while Andrew went to the living room.\n\nI hopped in the shower, put on my pajamas, and got under the covers. I closed my eyes immediately.\n\nI didn’t think I slept long before I was woken up by a loud knock on our front door.",

Where is Emma?” Logan asked nervously.\n\nHis voice was the most amazing sound I have ever heard. It was like music to my ears. What was wrong with me? It never sounded like that before. It must have been because I was tired.\n\nBut he sounded cold, rushed. I didn’t know why he was asking for me, but I had a feeling that I was in trouble. But I didn’t do anything wrong.\n\n“Emma?” my brother asked. “She is sleeping. Why?”\n\nI could hear surprise and confusion in his voice.\n\nI started walking toward the stairs and was instantly hit with the most amazing smell, pine needles and snow.

I couldn’t hear what he said to her, but I didn’t even want to. I shut them out completely.\n\nHe was confusing the hell out of me. First, he rejected me, and then he was all jealous and growling at Jake. What was his plan, anyway? Did he want to take Sienna as his mate and make me be alone forever because he couldn’t stand to see another man around me?\n\nThe most terrifying thing was that he could actually do that. Nobody could go against Alpha command. He could just order every male wolf to stay away from me and they would have to obey him.\n\nI got dressed as carefully as I could.

I didn’t even know if it is physical or emotional anymore.\n\nI sat down on my bed and leaned on the headboard.\n\nI heard the front door open and close, and I prayed to the Goddess that Loga",

        "content": "\"Guys, what do you think about a guy named Ben?\" Belle asked as she looked at the man's bio on her phone. She had just downloaded an app named 'Sex Mate,' where she could meet a random person to hook up with.\n\nShe was new in City S and was staying with her cousin and her roommate, who had just discovered she was a virgin and suggested the app for hookups.\n\nIt had been Belle's decision to remain a virgin all this while, but now she didn't find it such a good choice anymore, especially since she knew her cousin wasn't.\n\nThey both used to live with their grandma, who strongly believed in abstinence until marriage, but Belle was older now, and she knew she didn't want to be a virgin anymore.\n\n\"Ben who?\" Brie, her cousin, asked, applying lotion to her body even though she was about to go to sleep.\n\n\"Just Ben,\" Belle replied.\n\n\"But did you read his bio? Is he the kind of man you would want to have sex with?\" Cherry, Brie's roommate, asked.\n\n\"I don't know; there isn't much on his profile.\"\n\n\"There isn't much on your profile either; just pick any of them and fix a date,\" her cousin urged, getting into the big bed they all shared.\n\n\"And pick a date before Monday; you have to go to that media office for the internship, remember?\" Cherry added.\n\n\"Alright, alright, I'll pick Ben. He seems okay,\" Belle said, tapping the green button, which meant accept.\n\n\"I'm going to sleep,\" Brie announced, yawning, while Cherry just sat there scrolling through her phone.\n\n\"How do I know if he's online?\" Belle asked again, addressing the question to no one in particular.\n\n\"I don't know. I think there should be like a green dot or something,\" Cherry suggested.\n\n\"I'm not seeing it; I guess he isn't online,\" Belle said, almost disappointedly. She was hoping she could fix a date with him now because tomorrow she still had to send an email to the media house concerning her internship.\n\nSwitching off her phone, she turned in bed, trying to find a perfect sleeping position. Before she slept, she said good night to Cherry but then heard her phone's notification sound beep. Checking the phone, she saw that there was a notification from the Sex Mate app, and it was a message from him.\n\nIt was just a waving hand emoji. She didn't know what to reply since she was not the best at starting conversations.\n\n\"Ben,\" she just typed.\n\n\"Belle Miller,\" he texted back. \"You do know that you don't have to use your full name on this app, right?\" he added.\n\n\"It's my first time here; you must be active on this app,\" she texted again, smiling, hoping it was a good joke.\n\n\"It's my first time actually; some things aren't hard to figure out; common sense,\" she read and didn't know how to reply. \"You stay here in City S, right?\" he texted after she didn't respond.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she read his text not knowing how to reply again. \"You are beautiful,\" he let her know and was a little surprised when he didn't get a thanks from her.\n\n\"Let's fix a date,\" she finally typed after a short while.\n\n\"Pick a place,\" he replied when he noticed she wanted to get straight to the point.\n\n\"I don't know any places here yet, so I can't be the one to pick.\"\n\n\"So you are not from here?\" he asked and didn't get a reply from her.\n\n\"Cherry?\" Belle whispered when she noticed Brie was already asleep. Cherry turned to her to find out why she called. \"He's asking me to pick a place.\"\n\n\"Like a hotel?\" Cherry wanted to know.\n\n\"Like a hotel?\" She ignored his last question and replied directly, \"Pick a place.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she saw his reply and nodded to Cherry.\n\n\"Pun,\" Cherry whispered.\n\n\"Pun?\" Belle had to ask.\n\n\"Yeah, it's a new hotel; it should be okay.\"\n\n\"Pun,\" she texted him.\n\n\"Took quite a long time to think of a place.\" She didn't know what reply to give again. \"Is 7 O'clock good for you?\" he asked.\n\n\"7 o'clock when?\"\n\n\"Saturday.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, okay. Goodnight,\" she typed just because she was used to it but didn't wait for his reply.\n\nShe kept her phone in the drawer next to the bed and lay beside her cousin, trying to adjust to a comfortable position before sleeping.\n\n\"Are you done chatting with him?\" Cherry asked, looking up from her phone.\n\n\"Yeah, we fixed tomorrow, 7 pm.\"\n\n\"Okay, tomorrow you fill us in,\" Cherry chuckled.\n\n\"Goodnight,\" Belle said before finally laying her head on the pillow, thinking about what he would look like and how it would work out.\n\nShe hoped it would go well tomorrow.\n\n***\n\nSATURDAY EVENING\n\n\"Belle, come walk me to the laundromat, please,\" Brie begged, as it was her turn this week to do the laundry.\n\n\"Let her be; she needs to rest for tonight,\" Cherry said.\n\n\"It's just first-time sex; it's not like she's going to a boxing match or something.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have told you guys about any of this,\" Belle slapped her forehead, and the two girls laughed.\n\n\"Are you coming with me?\" Brie still asked.\n\n\"No, I'm sorry; it's past six already. I should be getting ready.\"\n\n\"Don't be sorry, Belle. She had all day to do it.\" Brie rolled her eyes at Cherry's statement.\n\n***\n\n\"Sir, I rescheduled the meeting you asked me to cancel yesterday to today,\" a woman walked into an office with a tablet in hand.\n\n\"When will it be?\" the man she had just informed asked, looking up from the laptop on his neatly arranged desk.\n\n\"In the next twenty-five minutes, sir,\" she answered, and he looked at his watch.\n\n\"7 pm?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Reschedule the meeting,\" he said, looking back at his computer.\n\n\"But sir, I already...\" She stopped speaking when he looked at her. She knew how much he didn't like to repeat himself, so she just walked away.",

        "content": "\"Cherry!\" Belle called from the room. \"I'm gonna borrow your lip gloss in front of the mirror table.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not mine. It's Brie's.\"\n\nBelle put it in her purse and went to the living room to ask Cherry how she looked, but she didn't get to ask that before she heard Cherry's remark about the outfit.\n\n\"What are you wearing?\" Cherry asked, sitting up from the couch.\n\n\"A dress?\"\n\n\"And leggings?\"\n\n\"It looks cold outside.\"\n\n\"The lip gloss, did you use it?\"\n\n\"No? I put it in my bag just in case my lips get dry,\" Belle answered, and Cherry couldn't help but sigh.\n\n\"Okay, let's start with the clothes,\" she said, going to the room to pick something better for Belle to wear.\n\nGoing through Belle's clothes, Cherry didn't find any of them worthy for the night. She had to take out one of her own dresses.\n\n\"Here, change into this.\"\n\n\"Yours?'\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"It looks short,\" Belle pointed out.\n\n\"Yeah, that's why I gave it to you. You are about to get laid.\"\n\n\"I'm sure not getting there by seven,\" Belle mumbled, changing into the dress Cherry had picked.\n\n\"Has she left?\" Brie came back, asking excitedly as she entered the room.\n\n\"She was about to; she was gonna wear leggings with this.\" Cherry passed the dress to her roommate.\n\n\"My grandma actually bought this,\" Brie laughed. \"We should go shopping, maybe next Saturday. Lots of her clothes are to my grandma's taste.\"\n\n\"Are you sure I should wear this?\" Brie asked, still undecided about the dress's length.\n\n\"Come on, it's not that short,\" Cherry said, making Brie turn to look at her cousin's sister.\n\nIt had a thin sleeve, making the dress almost sleeveless. It was a blue dress, which stopped right above her knee. Brie gaped in surprise when she saw her.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, Belle! You look fabulous.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Belle asked, still pulling down the dress.\n\n\"Did you tell her to wear a bra with it?\" Brie asked Cherry.\n\n\"No, she needs to take it off,\" Cherry said, and Belle swallowed.\n\n\"My bra?\"\n\n\"Yeah, baby, take it off,\" Cherry nodded.\n\n\"Fine.\" Belle went back to the bathroom to take it off while Brie and Cherry chatted on.\n\n\"If she comes out, you do her makeup,\" Cherry suggested.\n\n\"I still have to go back to the laundry place. I just came back to see how she looked.\"\n\n\"You fucking had all day, Brie; just help her, she's your cousin, and then you both can head out together.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay, but you have to go with her; she doesn't know the hotel; someone has to show her.\"\n\nAfter they had agreed, Belle was out again and Brie did light makeup on her. They soon left when they finished with Belle's dress-up.\n\n\"It's cold, guys.\" Belle shivered once they were outside.\n\n\"It's not that cold, just a little windy,\" Cherry said, about to lock the door to their apartment.\n\n\"Wait, I'll get her a scarf to prevent the cold till she gets there.\" Brie stopped her.\n\nBelle was about to inform them of how late she was but didn't say anything, seeing that Brie was getting her a scarf.\n\nThe cab stopped in front of the hotel's entrance. It had driven past the gate, so Belle didn't have to walk all the way.\n\n\"Alright, have fun,\" Cherry wished her as she was about to get down. Brie had stopped at the laundromat.\n\nBelle waved at the cab as it drove back. When she was about to enter the hotel, it occurred to her that she had forgotten the scarf because now she felt cold again.\n\nGetting into the hotel, she was glad at how warm it was inside. She walked up to the female receptionist standing at the reception table.\n\n\"Good evening, ma'am. How may I help you?\"\n\n\"Uhm, I'm here to meet...uhm... Ben, a Mr. Ben,\" she said, hoping he had already come.\n\n\"Just Ben?\"\n\n\"Uhm, I believe that is what he must have entered his name as. Look, I don't know; can you just help me check if there's a Ben on your list?\"\n\n\"Let me check.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nBelle watched the receptionist skim through the monitor in front of her. She noticed she had stopped clicking on the mouse.\n\n\"There is a Ben. You said you are to him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"One minute.\" The lady picked up the phone and placed a call, smiling reassuringly at Belle as her job required.\n\n\"Sir, so sorry to disturb you, but I need to be sure. You said a lady would show up by seven pm, and there's someone here...\" The lady stopped talking. She seemed to be listening to the person on the other side of the phone.\n\n\"What's your name, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Belle. Belle Miller,\" Belle replied.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the receptionist said. \"Sorry for wasting your time, ma'am. Here's the room card.\" She handed Belle one of the hotel cards, smiling professionally. \"Do enjoy your stay.\"\n\nBelle nodded; taking the card, she walked towards the elevator, looking at the card number. It read number twenty-six.\n\nWhen she got upstairs, she looked at the numbers on the many lined-up doors. She reached the one with twenty-six and stopped. Standing there, she drew in a long breath.\n\nAbout to open the door, an old cleaner passed by with her cleaning trolley, looking at her as she pushed it on. Belle began to imagine her grandmother's thoughts on what she was about to do.\n\nAfter convincing herself to carry on with her decision, she swiped the card and opened the door slowly and quietly. The room was dimly lit, but she could see well.\n\nShe walked in and closed the door behind her, still pulling down her dress. The room was as simple as it could be. There was a television on the wall, and its remote control was lying on the table next to the bed.\n\nBecause of the room's lighting, she couldn't tell what color the sheets were, but she was guessing they were either white or cream.\n\nThere were two mini sofas sitting opposite each other. She could see a man's coat neatly hung on the chair's arm, making it look like the chair was wearing the coat.\n\nShe walked to it, touching it slowly. It felt smooth on her palm as she caressed it. She bent over to smell it without removing it from the chair; it smelt good.",

        "content": "She bent over to smell it without removing it from the chair; it smelt good. It smelt like men's perfume.\n\nBen walked out of the bathroom wiping his hands with the small towel provided by the hotel. There was someone else in the room.\n\nHe wondered if it was her; he wondered if it was Belle. Standing there and watching her touch his suit jacket, which he had spread over the chair's arm, he thought she was sexy.\n\nEven with the sleeping lights, he thought she looked sexy in the dress she wore. When she bent over to smell his jacket, he could see her dress go up. He walked to the bedside and turned on the brighter light; she turned around immediately.\n\n\"Belle?\" He asked in a low, deeply masculine voice.\n\n\"Yes. Ben, right?\" She saw a man in a long-sleeved shirt.\n\n\"Yes.\" He walked to her. \"Fuck, you are beautiful,\" he muttered, even though she could hear him. He was amazed by her beauty. He admired how she made her hair into a fine ponytail and how he could see her clear shoulders, with no hair to cover them, just the thin strap of her dress.\n\n\"You are very pretty,\" he said again.\n\n\"I know.\" He chuckled at her reply and then let it turn into a smile.\n\n\"I guess you are used to such compliments,\" he said, and she smiled.\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm late. My friends thought I didn't look good enough in the dress I intended to wear.\"\n\n\"Your friends know where you were coming to? And why?\"\n\n\"Well... they think I'm going on a date,\" she lied, knowing how weird it sounded that they knew.\n\n\"They did a good job. I don't know what you intended to wear before this, but I'm sure you would still look as beautiful.\"\n\nShe didn't say anything more; she just stood there fumbling with her fingers, trying to control her nervousness. He came closer to her. Standing directly in front of her, she noticed how much taller he was.\n\n\"Are we about to...\" she wanted to ask with her head down. She didn't want to ask that while looking at him, but he lifted his jaw to face her.\n\n\"What?\" He asked her, caressing her cheek with his left hand.\n\n\"You have blue eyes,\" he noticed.\n\nShe looked down to avoid his dark eyes. She wouldn't say so, but she found them scary. She just didn't know how much they were filled with hunger.\n\n\"Are you going to...\" she was about to ask again, but he cut her off with his answer.\n\n\"No,\" he said, making her look back up at him with surprise.\n\n\"No?\" He smirked when she asked. He went closer to her, leaned in like he was going to kiss her, but placed his lips next to her ears. He placed both his hands on her slender neck while he still played with her cheeks.\n\n\"I don't make love. I fuck. I fuck hard,\" he whispered in her ears with his magnetic voice. It sent shivers through her.\n\nHe looked back at her to get a reaction from her. She licked her lips. She wiped off her lip gloss in the elevator just because she wasn't comfortable, but now they were a little dry, so she licked them, but he found it seducing.\n\nHe took her purse from her and put it on the table in between the two sofas. He took off her earrings, walked over to the bedside table, and kept them beside his watch and a ring.\n\nComing back to where she stood, he caressed her shoulder, his hands slowly sliding down the thin strap holding her dress. It stopped at her elbow, and he began to kiss her right arm. He got back to her shoulder, and she stopped him.\n\n\"Are you married?\" She asked worriedly. She was going against her grandmother, losing her virginity this way, but she would never have sex with a married man or one in a relationship.\n\nHe chortled for a short while before stopping when he noticed she wasn't also laughing.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" he replied, smiling.\n\n\"The ring.\" She was standing far from the table where the ring was and couldn't tell what kind of ring it was, but she had to be sure\n\n\"My father's ring, mine now.\" He stopped smiling. \"You don't know who I am, do you?\"\n\n\"I don't; you don't know who I am either; I'm just being careful.\"\n\nHe smiled again.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with that,\" he stated.\n\nEveryone in City S knew he wasn't married, but she didn't. Now he knew she wasn't from this city because if she was, she would know who she was about to have a one-night stand with.\n\nAll she knew was that his name was Ben and that he was twenty-nine years old. She didn't even know what he looked like before she came to the hotel. He expected her to be surprised when he turned the light on and when she saw who it was.\n\n\"Can I see it?\" She requested.\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe nodded. He got the ring and showed it to her. She took it. Looking at it now, it was obvious it wasn't a wedding ring. It had an inscription on it: B L. She gave it back to him.\n\n\"Can I fuck you now?\" He asked standing as close as he was to her before with the tip of his nose touching her forehead.\n\n\"Don't say fuck. I'd rather you call it sex,\" she said, feeling his warm breath on her forehead.\n\n\"Why? It sounds too vulgar?\" He asked again, but she didn't say anything. \"You know, maybe I should make love to you.\" He came to her right ear, kissing it. He heard her hum a little with pleasure.\n\nHe caressed her cheekbone slowly with his thumb, tracing it down to her lips. He admired them as he played with them using his thumb. He rubbed them slowly like he was putting lipstick on them.",

        "content": "He leaned in and touched her lips with his, not kissing her yet. He just caressed her lips with his, teasing her because she closed her eyes when he leaned in, ready for a kiss.\n\nHe sucked on her upper lips first, feeling how soft they were. He enveloped both her lips now, and he heard that 'mmnn' from her again. He loved it.\n\nShe didn't return his kiss at first. She just let him play with her lips; she enjoyed it. She hadn't felt his tongue in her mouth yet; she wanted that, so she grabbed onto his neck to kiss him back, still with her eyes closed. But he moved away from her a little, and she longed for those lips that just left hers.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, he wasn't in front of her; he was behind her now. he kissed her neck, and he got her soft moan again.\n\nHe pulled on her dress's zipper at the back of the dress, exposing her bare back. With the tip of his nose, he caressed her naked shoulder, slowly moving to the nape of her neck.\n\nShe tilted her head backward when he began to place wet kisses across her back, and when he stopped at her waist, where he had unzipped to, he made her dress fall from her body.\n\nShe stood there, nothing else on her body but her lacy underwear, surprised at herself for not being ashamed as naked as she was. He admired her body from behind, marveling at her perfectly curved waist, from her back to her round ass, which was evenly sized.\n\n\"Belle,\" he called her. She was about to turn to his voice, but he stopped her. \"Don't.\" She obeyed; she wanted a good first time, so she was ready to do whatever he told her as long as he was going to fuck her well. She had no doubt about it. His touch was different. He made her nipples hard with just the touch of his fingertips. She didn't even know how he could do that. She had explored her body quite a few times; she would let her exes do things to her body but was strict with the 'no sex' thing, but this man, he had this touch, a touch that was messing with her senses.\n\nHe wasn't even touching her breasts, but she knew her nipples wanted his touch; they were getting harder and beginning to hurt. He kissed her shoulder, his hands still patrolling her chest area.\n\nHe ran his fingers across her chest, going down to her navel; she was panting heavily now, and she wanted him to touch her privates, but he wasn't doing that. He was torturing her, and he knew.\n\n\"Belle?\" he came in front of her. \"Do you want me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She nodded before answering.\n\nShe thought he didn't know what to do with her naked body, but now she knew he was doing it purposefully when she saw the smirk on his face.\n\n\"Why did you have to possess such a beautiful body, Belle?\" he said, and she looked at him, confused. \"I want to do things to you, to your body. I want to fuck you rough, but you...\" he paused and lifted her jaw to face him. \"You look too graceful for that.\" He was no longer smiling. He was saying with seriousness. \"I'm not sure you can take in all of me.\" He looked into her eyes again. \"Can you?\"\n\nShe didn't know what to answer; she didn't even know if she could or not; she had never been penetrated before. Short of words, her breath sounded muffled. Cherry had advised not to make it known on her profile that she was a virgin.\n\n\"Many men don't like women who are inexperienced in bed,\" she had said.\n\n\"You are not going to answer me, are you?\" he slid two of his fingers into her panties.\n\n\"Ahhh,\" she moaned when he grazed her pussy lips with his hands. He took off his shirt and threw her to the bed. Going on top of her, he kissed her neck rather roughly, and when his lips touched her spiky nipples, she threw her head backward in pain and pleasure because he was grating her left nipple with his teeth while his hands squeezed on her right.\n\nKissing her torso, he put his pinky in her deep navel, and she didn't know how, but it made her ache down there, wanting him to just do anything to her pussy. His lips stopped at her panties' waistline, and he looked up to see her, loving the way she was moaning. He placed a wet kiss in between her legs, and though she still had her panty on, she could feel his lips; it made her sit up to push his face away from her open legs.\n\n\"Lay back down,\" he ordered, but she shook her head; she'd never had a man's face in between her legs. Even after standing naked comfortably in front of this man, she felt too hormonal right now to listen to him, but Ben Larkson wasn't one to have his order disobeyed, not in the office and not in the bedroom.\n\nHe swiftly came back up, making her rest her back against the pillows as he leaned in more and more till he was directly on top of her, pressing himself against her even with his weight supported by his own hands trapping her on the bed. He could feel her hard nipples poke his chest as she breathed heavily and slowly in his face because he was that close to her.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he asked her in a quiet but still deep voice. She didn't say anything; she couldn't, not because she was scared, even though she should be, considering how his dark eyes were staring directly at her. She just didn't know what to answer.\n\n\"You,\" she managed to say. He smirked again, and it was then she noticed the faint dimple present on his cheeks. He was a handsome man; she knew he knew it.\n\n\"If you want me, then do as I say,\" he said, making it sound like a question. She nodded. \"Good,\" she heard him repeat that word.\n\nJust like he came up, he was back down, between her legs; he looked at her; he thought she looked a little scared of what he was about to do to her.\n\n\"I'll try to be gentle,\" he said in a voice she found trustworthy.",

        "content": "He tore off her lacy underwear impatiently just as soon as he said those words to her. After he had smelt it, satisfied, he threw it to the side of the bed.\n\n\"Belle,\" he couldn't help but call, getting more erect as he saw her exposed vagina. She just laid there watching him eat her up with his eyes. He kissed it, making her moan with a slightly louder pitch this time; she sat up again, filled with a tingling sensation, but laid back down.\n\nShe was trying her best to do as he said, but it was hard as she could feel his warm breath down below. He kissed her there again, making her toes curl as she wriggled in bed.\n\nShe couldn't take it anymore when he began sucking her pussy; it made her lose it as she moaned loudly now, she attempted pushing his head away, but she was too weakened by pleasure to do so.\n\n\"You look so tight,\" he said when he finally stopped. She tried to close her legs, but his hands were there to stop her. He parted them wider than they were. She watched him about to put his face between her legs again, and it made her squirm in bed even before he did.\n\nShe felt his tongue on her clit. She rubbed her face with both her hands, trying to curtail how satisfying it felt.\n\n\"Ohhh...ahhh, mmmm,\" she moaned loudly when he began thrusting her with his tongue. He stopped, and he could hear her planting loudly. He climbed back on top of her, kissing her again from her pussy upwards. He stopped when he reached her breast. He had fucked women with bigger breasts, but he liked how not so big hers were; he thought they fitted her perfect body.\n\nHe kissed in between them and went for her neck, but she pulled his face closer to hers, wanting a kiss, and he gave it to her. Unlike the first time he kissed her, he was rough, but she enjoyed how he possessed her lips and mouth as a whole.\n\n\"Make love to me,\" she pleaded when their lips separated, feeling she couldn't wait anymore.\n\nHe had that smirk again.\n\n\"You want me to make love to you, huh?\" He asked, and she nodded without thought.\n\nHe got off her and left the bed. She wondered why he did that, but it turned into blankness when he took off his trousers in front of her view. He wore no briefs. It was just his veiny erection facing her.\n\n\"Can you take in all of this?\" He asked, walking to his suit jacket spread out on one of the sofas. She swallowed; his manhood wasn't just veiny; it was thick and long. With his back turned while he took a condom from his suit pocket, she admired his small smooth ass.\n\nHe began walking back to the bed, and her eyes couldn't go off the snake below his waist, which stood erect, facing her as he approached.\n\n\"Can you?\" He repeated his question, seriousness written over him. She nodded quickly, not knowing what she was opting for. He climbed back over her. She could feel his hardness scale over her thigh when he came closer to her face.\n\n\"I should warn you; once I start, I won't stop till I want to.\" She nodded again. \"Good.\"\n\nWith her consent gotten, he tore open one of the five condoms he held; after throwing the others on the other bedside table, she turned her head in that direction and looked at it before looking back at him just in time to see him professionally wear the condom on his dick. She swallowed again, her heart beating to her hearing. She was finally getting what she wanted.\n\n\"I'm safe,\" she thought she should inform him that she had no sexual disease when he had worn the condom.\n\n\"I know. I am as well.\" He smiled. \"We don't want to get you pregnant, do we?\" She nodded again to his words.\n\nWith one of his hands, he maintained his balance over her, and with the other, he held his dick closer to her open core, rubbing it against her clit and watching her squirm as he teased her, and when she least expected it, he thrust her with just the tip of it.\n\nShe writhed beneath him with pleasure and excitement. He leaned in now that he was inside her, thrusting a little more as he kissed her neck. She held the sheet that she laid on, trying to withhold the pain. He added more length inside her, liking how tight and wet she was, but she couldn't take it.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" It was her loudest moan yet.\n\n\"You seem so tight,\" he whispered softly in her right ear, gently kissing it, but he noticed her sniffle. Some of the women he had been intimate with had cried, too, and it had spurred him on to continue. He had only entered her halfway.\n\n\"Stop,\" he heard her weakly say, and as he looked at her face, he saw tears welling up in her eyes. \"I can't,\" she pleaded, placing her delicate hands on his broad chest in an attempt to push him away. \"It's too much. It hurts.\" He gazed into her beautiful blue eyes, and suddenly it dawned on him.\n\n\"Are you...?\" His excitement grew as he thought he had figured it out. \"Are you a virgin?\" he asked, and she met his intense gaze with her teary eyes, blinking twice but without a response.\n\n\"You are,\" he deduced, now understanding. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" he inquired, only eliciting another sniffle from her. Tenderly, he caressed her face, noticing the redness in her nose and lips. \"Where have you been?\"",

As her eyes fluttered open, she reached out to find her phone, a habit she had developed over time. However, much to her dismay, it wasn't where she usually left it.\n\nIn a tired daze, Belle was about to drift back to sleep when the phone started ringing loudly, jolting her awake. Searching the room with bleary eyes, she realized the sound was coming from the mini table between the cream-colored sofas. Sighing in resignation, she knew she couldn't ignore it any longer and reluctantly made her way towards the phone, her legs feeling weak and shaky from the late night to morning's activities with Ben..\n\nWhen she finally answered the call, she heard the concerned voice of her cousin Brie on the other end. \"Belle, are you okay?\" Brie asked, her worry palpable.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm just tired,\" Belle replied, her naked body not bothering her as she paced",

        "content": "\"Thank you so much for coming to meet him, Ben,\" Jenna said when they were both about to get into the car they came in. Jason smiled, genuinely this time.\n\n\"Don't tell your mum about her,\" Ben said to her. He didn't want her to converse with her mother, his aunt about Belle because then, his aunt would talk to his mother and she would want to delve into the matter and find out about Belle and what he had with her and most predictably beg him repeatedly and non-stop to start something serious with Belle and he couldn't do that.\n\nHe didn't want any of that to happen and Jenna not telling her mum about Belle could stop all of that from happening. He knew and could see how excited Jenna was when he arrived with Belle, she probably assumed he had already started something serious with her and was only keeping it secret but that wasn't the case.\n\nWhen the car started to drive out of the yard, Belle decided to ask him what she had",

        "content": "Both seated inside a different restaurant from last night, Ben watched Belle devour the dish in front of her. He couldn't stop smiling because it had been so long since he sat with someone, a woman who was willing to be as free as Belle was as she ate the spaghetti she ordered.\n\nShe didn't even remember he was there with her, the food was delicious and she was hungry, that was all she knew as she ate on.\n\nShe sucked in a strand of spaghetti into her mouth even though her lips were pressed together. Some spaghetti sauce stained her lips when she did that so she reached for the table napkins at the middle of the set table and that was when she remembered Ben was sitting with her.\n\nHer right hand was on the napkins like she was frozen, she looked up slowly and he was smiling, that genuine smile that she had noticed was rare and scarce to the public. She became grateful that there was no one else sharing the part of the restaurant where they sat with them, it wa",

She had seen it coming, she had read all about him and his dislike for the topic of love. She knew he would say what he just said before now. He had told her during her interview with him that he wasn't a romantic.\n\n\"Okay.\" She just said and picked up her glass of water in front of her, taking a sip from it.\n\n\"Okay?

She could listen to this man holding her, talk all day and agree with whatever he said.\n\n\"Alright then, let's go shopping.\" He held her and they headed out.\n\nThey were still in the driving car, both in their own thoughts when Belle's phone started to vibrate in her purse. Ben looked at her to try and know why she wasn't picking up her phone as it rang on.\n\nHe realized that her mind was lost, so he called her back;\n\n\"Belle.\"\n\n\"Hmmn?\" She turned to him sharply, disengaging from her far thoughts.\n\n\"Your phone seems to be ringing.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" She open her purse to get the phone out but it had stopped ringing.\n\nShe checked on",

        "content": "‘Sometimes the person you’d take a bullet for is behind the trigger.’\n\n***\n\n[1,000 years ago at the Gate of Darkness]\n\n“You betrayed me, Tharollin. How could you do that to me?” Avonmora, the queen of mermaids, asked in a teary voice the man she had once referred to as her lover. She was just in time to stop him from opening the Gate of Darkness.\n\n“For powers, my love, to open the Gate of Darkness, I have to sleep with you and collect your blood, which you gave me too willingly.” Tharollin, the demon king, answered her with a smirk.\n\n“I thought you were the one. The gods made you my soulmate, Tharollin; you are my soulmate, and whatever I did for you was out of love. I gave you myself and my blood, thinking you wanted to use my blood and heal the wounds you had last when you fought with Roen, but I was wrong. You only collected it to use it and open the Gates of Darkness.”\n\n“You've forgotten something, sweetheart. I am a demon, in fact, the king of demons; we don't have feelings. Opening the Gate of Darkness will make me the strongest of them all, and I shall rule over the supernaturals.” Tharollin said. “And even if I want to have a lover, it wouldn't be a fish girl. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a gate to open.”\n\n“I was warned to stay away from you, but did I listen? No. Tharollin, you still have a chance to change. Do not open the Gate of Darkness, please, I beg you,” Avonmora pleaded, hoping to Gods that they would change his heart.\n\nTharollin laughed at her foolishness. “You're a big fool, Avonmora; you were blinded by love; that is why you couldn't see my main motive.”\n\n***\n\n[Flashback]\n\nTharollin, a very handsome and tempting demon king, lost his rights as king when he went to war against King Roen and the rest of the supernaturals, except the mermaids; they were healers. King Roen, who had the backing of the Gods, was the one who had defeated him, and they killed all his demon warriors and imprisoned the ones alive.\n\nHe ran away from the battlefield with serious injuries. He ran into Avonmora, who was heading towards the battlefield with some of her healers.\n\nSeeing him for the first time was like seeing the Sun. Her crystal necklace shone a little bit, and she knew the man bleeding profusely was her soulmate. Avonmora quickly ordered the rest to go without her as she teleported Tharollin to her cave to treat him.\n\nTheir love story began…\n\n“Did you know what you asked for, Avonmora?” King Roen asked the beautiful mermaid standing before him.\n\n“Yes, I know what I am asking, Roen. Help me and plead with the rest of the kings and queens that they shouldn't harm Tharollin. You know they listen to you.”\n\n“This is difficult, and you know it. Helping the evil king of demons who went rebellious against all Supernaturals is different, saying we should give him a second chance is another thing.”\n\n“He is my soulmate, Roen; you know what that means. Please stand with me. He has changed. We should give him a second chance.” Avonmora pleaded.\n\n“I am only supporting you because of what we had in the past. Do not come back to me when he betrays you. I won't listen then.”\n\n“Thank you so much, Roen. He won't betray me,” Avonmora said with happiness.\n\n“I will set up a meeting with the rest of the kings and queens soon. Bring him with you when you come to the meeting, Avonmora.”\n\n***\n\n[Meeting]\n\n“This is outrageous! How can we trust a demon who wants to rule over the Supernaturals?” Queen of the fairies, Flora, spat out with venom as she stared at Tharollin with disdain.\n\n“He isn't the same person you once knew. Please, he's changed, and I can swear on my life. He is my soulmate, my better half. Queen Flora, you got married to the king of goblins, didn't you even when we kicked against it. My fellow kings and queens, I am also a queen, and I know how you want our people to feel safe, but believe me, Tharollin isn't evil.” Avonmora said.\n\n“Roen, what is your intake in this?” King Davea, asked the Wolf King. A Davea is a creature of shadow, a special type of demon, which is periodically used by other demons, similarly to hellhounds.\n\nThe room where the meeting was held became quiet as they all wanted to hear Roen’s opinion.\n\n“Let's give him a second chance, as she said.” King Roen told them finally.\n\n“Are you supporting her because she was once your fuck mate?” Darin, the King of Vampires asked as he started picking invisible dirt from his nails.\n\nThe growl that came out from Roen shook the whole room they were in. Standing up to his feet in anger.\n\n“I dare you to repeat what you said AGAIN,” Roen pronounced each word with a growl as he stared hatefully at the Vampire King.\n\n“But I was telling the truth,” Darin said with a smile.\n\n“That's enough from the both of you. We have heard from Avonmora, and since the Wolf King has given his consent, we shall. Tharollin has been forgiven, but Avonmora takes note. If he tries to bring harm to any of the kingdoms, you know the consequences, don't you?” The Queen of Witches, Lillian, said.\n\n“Yes, I know the consequences. Thank you all,” Avonmora said with a smile.\n\n[End of flashback]\n\n***\n\n“You played me all along, but I won't let you open the Gate of Darkness.”\n\n“Too late for that, my love. You came too late. I have already made the sacrifice, mixing the blood of a powerful mermaid and my blood together, and you are just a mermaid without any fighting skills. Should I remind you that as a demon, your powers don't affect me? So very soon, all Supernaturals will be mine to rule. Join me, Avonmora. Let's rule all of them together.”\n\n“Over my dead body will I do that.”\n\n“Your choice, my gain. Goodbye, Avonmora,” Tharollin said, turning his back to her and going towards the Gate of Darkness.\n\n“You will die in there; do not open the Gate Tharollin, please. The evil behind that gate will affect everyone. For the sake of our child I am carrying, please don't open that gate.”\n\nThat stopped Tharollin, who then turned to face Avonmora with the coldest look she had ever seen. “Using those lines doesn't work for me. A demon king like myself can't have children.” With that, he walked over to where the Gate of Darkness was, stood in front of it, and uttered the words that had been forbidden.\n\nThe Gate of Darkness was said to be the inhabitant of Lucifer, an evil being who was killed, and his bones were locked up by the gods. Whoever opens the gate of Darkness and possesses the bones of Lucifer shall have the powers of the once-powerful being.\n\nLucifer's bones weren't the only ones in it.\n\nTharollin smiled as he finished casting out the spell.\n\nThe Gate of Darkness began to open slowly. Inside the Gate, there was pure darkness.\n\n“Do not move any further, Tharollin!” King Darin shouted at the demon who stopped once he heard his voice.\n\nTharollin turned and saw all the Kings and Queens of the supernaturals before him.\n\n“You alerted them, Avonmora,” Tharollin said without any surprise as the gate behind him continued opening. Just one step and he was inside the Gate.\n\n“I have to. I am sorry,” Avonmora replied.\n\n“Well, great kings and queens, I don't have much time to discuss with you all, but I will get to see you all in the next 1,000 years to come. Be sure you are still alive when I return, for I shall have my revenge on all of you standing before me.”\n\n“That is if you enter the gate,” Roen said, but it was already too late.\n\n“Too late. You all are always late. I shall return with my armies to defeat you all and rule over every supernatural.” Tharollin said as he finally moved back, one of his feet entering the gate. ”Goodbye. See you all in 1,000 years.” With that saying, his second feet entered the gate. As soon as his two feet were inside the gate, a dark hole opened beneath his feet, and he fell down towards it. The dark hole closes.\n\nLillian used her magic to prevent the gate from opening further.\n\n***\n\n[Meeting room]\n\n“This is all your fault!” Queen Flora shouted. “Now the Gate of Darkness is opened; it won't take much time before it starts to turn everyone into evil.”\n\n“I am sorry. I didn't know he would do something like that,” Avonmora said softly.\n\nDarin wanted to say something hurtful to Avonmora when a bright light shone before them before it vanished.\n\nA beautiful lady stood where the bright light was, all dressed in white as the Kings and Queens all stood up and bowed to her and sat down again. Her eyeballs were white, and her forehead bore a circle.\n\n“The priestess is always there whenever we need her.” King Davea said with a smile.\n\n“I did not bring good news; the gods are angry. The Gate of Darkness is opened, and it will cause a great war if it is not closed in time.” The priestess said.\n\n“What then should we do?” Lillian asked.\n\n“The only way to close the gate of Darkness is to sacrifice the one who had caused it.”\n\nAll eyes turned to look at Avonmora, some with hate, others in pity.\n\n“Then Avonmora shall be sacrificed to avoid whatever evil that wants to befall us.” King Darin said.\n\n“Not only her. You know what it took the gods to lock down the Gate of Darkness after they defeated Lucifer. Her people, every single mermaid and merman, shall be sacrificed to close down the Gate in two days' time.” The priestess said and vanished.\n\n“You all heard her. In two days' time, Avonmora and her people shall be killed.” Queen Flora said with a smile.\n\n“But killing them all, won't that be the end of mermaids?” Roen asked.\n\n“The gods have spoken, Roen, and there is no going back.” Darin said as he stood up to meet Avonmora. “Enjoy your last days with your people.” He left the meeting room.\n\nSoon everyone began to leave the room except Roen and Lillian.\n\nStanding up to his feet. “I warned you, but I can understand since he was your soulmate. But this time around, I can't help you; the gods are now involved.” With a sad smile, Roen left the meeting room, leaving Lillian alone with her.\n\n“Lillian, I am pregnant with the demon child. What should I do?”\n\n“Shhhh, the walls have ears. Teleport us now to my chambers.”\n\nAvonmora nodded her head and teleported them to Lillian's lair. Casting a magic spell around the wall to prevent anyone from eavesdropping on their conversation.\n\n“Repeat what you just told me a few minutes ago?”\n\n“I am pregnant with Tharollin, I told him, but he thought I was joking. Help me. I don't want my child to die with me. Please, my sister, save my child.”\n\n***\n\n[Two days later]\n\nAll the supernaturals gathered to witness the execution of the mermaids' race in front of the Gate of Darkness.\n\nThe priestess stood before the Gate as she gestured with her head to the Vampire warriors to begin. They started killing the mermaids.\n\nSoon, all the mermaids and mermen lay dead, leaving only Avonmora.\n\nThe priestess walked over to meet her. “Your punishment will be so different. The gods want your soul, but your body shall be placed at the front Gate of Darkness to warn anyone who has your fish brain.” She told Avonmora and touched the mermaid's forehead.\n\nHer soul in a smoky form began to come out from her mouth. The priestess brought out a diamond stone, and her soul went into it.\n\nAvonmora's body slumped as her eyes were wide open, her lifeless eyes looking straight at Lillian. It was as if it was reminding her of her promise she made to her two days ago.\n\nThe priestess smiled and levitated Avonmora's body and made it stand at the Gate. Her body immediately turned into ice.\n\nThe priestess said some words, and the gate started closing. It stopped before it finally shut.\n\n“What happened? The Gate isn't shut completely.” Flora said.\n\nThe priestess, who was equally surprised, closed her eyes briefly and opened it. “There is still one more mermaid missing.”\n\n“Impossible, all the mermaid clan has been killed, so which one are you talking about?” Darin asked.\n\n“A mermaid yet to be born. Her blood shall be used in shutting down the Gate of Darkness completely.”\n\n“How is that possible?” Roen demanded.\n\n“I don't know, but it wasn't revealed to me. I shall consult the gods and get back to you all.” The priestess replied and vanished before anyone questioned her further.\n\n***\n\nLillian entered her Chambers and made sure she locked the door. Saying a spell, a door appeared, and she entered it.\n\nThe door opened to another hidden room. In the middle of the room was a ball, which looked more like nylon floating with a very tiny fetus in it.\n\nShe had promised Avonmora she would take care of her child.\n\n“Promise me, Lillian, nothing will happen to my child. You're a very strong witch. I know you can do something to prevent my child from dying with me.”\n\n“I will help you because you once helped me before.”\n\n“Thank you, but you must promise me, Lillian, not to tell her who her parents were. I have a strong feeling that it's a girl. If it is a girl, please do name her Rae, because she is my Rae of light, but if it is a boy, you name him. And one more thing, please hide her powers, especially if she carries the demon blood.”\n\n“Of course, Avonmora. Come on, we don't have much time.” Lillian said and pronounced the spell. The same door appeared and they entered inside.\n\nLillian smiled as she went over to where the ball was floating.\n\nSince the child had demon blood in him or her, it would take almost 1,000 years before the ball burst.\n\n***\n\nThe priestess appeared on top of the mountain where she lived.\n\nShe didn't see that coming; killing off the mermaids and using their blood at the gate was for a purpose. She couldn't tell the people that the yet-to-be-born mermaid she saw would be born in a thousand years to come, but who would give birth to the mermaid?",

        "content": "'There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.'\n\n***\n\nShe sat down at the mountain top and started meditating, searching every nook and cranny of each Supernaturals kingdom but to no avail.\n\nThe priestess was livid as she tried to see if something was hidden away from her, but no matter how hard she tried, nothing showed up.\n\nShe stood up as a door opened right there in front of her, midair.\n\nEntering it, it closes behind her. She found herself in a room, a big bowl of red water appeared in front of her, as she started to make some incantations. \"Water, water, show me what is being hidden, who is the last mermaid that is yet to be born? Show me her face or mother?\"\n\nThe red water started swirling around the bowl, and a mouth was seen opening. She peeped inside the opened mouth only to see darkness. The mouth vanished and the water became still.\n\n\"Something doesn't feel right.\" The priestess said, staring at the still red water.\n\n\"I know that, Tamara.\" A deep male baritone voice said behind her.\n\nThe priestess now known as Tamara, wasn't frightened when she heard male voice.\n\n\"You shouldn't be here, I am taking care of everything.\" Tamara said and turned to face him.\n\nStanding before her was a man made of water.\n\n\"Just because I gave you enough powers to become the priestess of all Supernaturals doesn't mean you should talk to me in such a manner.\" The water man said.\n\n\"I am sorry my Lord, forgive my manners. I just thought you should be resting as you had drained all the blood of the mermaids clan. I wasn't expecting you.\" Tamara said as she lowered her head.\n\n\"I already did that but I am still thirsty for that last blood. Our plan worked out from the beginning. I made Avonmora soulmate to the demon king, Tharollin. She had thought that the gods had blessed her with Tharollin, but she didn't know the truth. I have Tharollin where I want him, for I will need a strong body for me to occupy when it's time.\" The man in a water form said and laughed out. \"And again, I shall need Roen's blood to complete the ritual, he is the strongest Wolf.\"\n\n\"Why his blood?\" Tamara asked not getting it.\n\n\"I mean, someone that will come out from his loins, set him up with a maiden that he will impregnate. And once it's time I shall have that child.\" He said as he already mapped out his plans.\n\nIf only he knew the child would be a Tribrid supernatural, he wouldn't have suggested the plan.\n\n\"Of course my Lord. But what should I tell the Kings and Queens when they asked what the gods had said. We still haven't found out where the last mermaid is.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what to do, for now, your focus should be on finding out where the mermaid will be born so that you can bring her to me. I, on the other hand, shall keep on blinding the god's. And once Tharollin gets my bones from the Gate of Darkness, I shall reveal myself to them.\"\n\nTamara nodded her head as she handed the diamond stone which held the soul of Avonmora to the water man who vanished immediately.\n\n***\n\n[Meeting room]\n\n\"Queen Lillian, since we haven't heard a word from our priestess since yesterday after the slaughter of the Mermaid Clan, what are we going to do since the gate is still open?\" Queen Flora asked as she fling one of her fingers upwards and a rose flower appeared in it, which she started playing with.\n\n\"I can't really answer you Queen Flora until the priestess comes.\" Lillian answered with a smile.\n\nBefore anyone could speak, Tamara appeared before them. She didn't come alone, she came with a beautiful lady who looks a little bit like her.\n\nStanding up to their feet, they greeted the priestess and sat down.\n\n\"Without wasting much time, the gods have not yet revealed who will give birth to the last evil mermaid that will close the gate of Darkness. But, they have given us a solution.\" Tamara said with a smile.\n\n\"What solution priestess?\" King Davea asked.\n\nTamara turned and pointed at the lady standing beside her. \"She is the Solution.\"\n\n\"She is beautiful.\" King Darin complimented as he stared lustfully at the lady. \"Did you bring this damsel for me?\" He added.\n\n\"Not for you Darin, the gods want Roen to marry Rosa, who is my cousin. The child you both shall bear will be the one to know where the last mermaid is and sacrifice her to the gods. She is the ultimate sacrifice, only when the mermaid is sacrificed, can the gate close forever.\"\n\nKing Roen, a very handsome werewolf, was surprised when he heard the news. He raised up his head to refuse the offer when the words frozen mid way. Standing before him was a very beautiful maiden, his soulmate, he has imprinted on her.\n\nWhen a shape-shifter, a Wolf, imprints on a specific girl or woman, he becomes unconditionally bound to her for the rest of his life. When it happens, the experience is described as being gravitationally pulled toward that person while a glowing heat fills him, and everyone and everything else in his life becomes secondary, and only the imprintee is left to matter, leaving the shape-shifter with a deep need to do anything to please and protect his soulmate. It's not like love at first sight, really. It's more like… gravity moves… suddenly. It's not the earth holding you here anymore, she does… You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that's a protector, or a lover, or a friend.\n\nHe had hoped his imprint would be Avonmora, but the gods couldn't grant him his heart desires, and now, she is dead.\n\nKing Roen stood up to his feet quickly and went over to meet Rosa, he hugged her smiling. \"I have found my imprint at last, she is my soulmate.\"\n\nThe rest of the Kings and Queens all helped a smile except Darin who was sulking. The Wolf King has finally found his soulmate after three thousand years of searching.\n\n\"Congrats.\" Filled the room.\n\n\"But how did you know your cousin would be his soulmate?\" Lillian demanded suspiciously.\n\n\"That's because the gods revealed that my cousin should be brought here for King Roen to see. And thanks be to the gods for their knowledge.\" Tamara said. \"The gods also demanded that the Wolf King be made as the King of all Supernaturals, since his lovely wife will give birth to the one who will save us all. A school shall be built where all the children from each clan will be attending.\" With that she disappeared leaving her cousin behind.\n\nLillian felt something was amiss but let it slide. Tamara didn't mention of how to prevent the blackness from the gate from spreading out, anyway, that's the work of a witch.\n\n***\n\n[1,000 years later]\n\n\"I am sorry Queen Lillian, but I cannot take back your grandchild, she will be transferred.\" The proprietor of the witch school told the queen sitting in her office.\n\n\"Ash, just give her a second chance she will change, I promise.\" Queen Lillian pleaded on behalf of Rae.\n\nRae, who looked less concerned about the discussion they were having right in front of her, was blowing a whistle as she placed her legs on top of the proprietor table.\n\nAsh was already used to Rae's behavior.\n\n\"Even though you rule us, with all due respect my queen, I still maintain my stand. Rae beat up her seniors badly, they are still in the hospital recovering, she is so stubborn and do whatever pleases her, she is getting out of our control. So I have no other choice my queen. I am transferring her to the Supernaturals school and that's finally.\" Ash said and brought out a letter. \"This is a recommendation letter that you will give to the Principal of the supernatural. It talks about the behavior of Rae so that he can warn his students to stay away from her.\"\n\n\"I will talk to her, but try to reconsider your decision.\" Lillian said\n\n\"I, in fact all the teachers, have had enough of her, there is nothing I can do.\"\n\n\"Grandma, can you excuse us for a minute? I want to speak to Mrs Ash alone, please.\" Rae said as she stopped her whistle.\n\nGetting up to her feet, \"I will be outside, do not do something stupid.\" With that Lillian left the office.\n\n\"What is it Rae? If you want to beg me to allow you back into this school, I am afraid my answer is still No.\"\n\n\"I am not begging you Mrs proprietor. The letter in your hand, change it and write how wonderful and helpful I am to your school.\"\n\n\"You don't tell a five hundred years old teacher what to do.\"\n\n\"You seem to have forgotten who you are talking to, I am Rae, wherever I go I cause trouble. And also I know what side of the bed you sleep at night, don't allow me to visit you tonight. Change that recommendation letter at once.\"",

        "content": "'Being stubborn can be a good thing. Being stubborn can be a bad thing. It just depends on how you use it. I'm a very stubborn person, but not so stubborn that I can't learn new things and meet new people, but I have a one-track mind.'\n\n***\n\n\"You can't tell me what to do Rae, I am the proprietor of this witch school and you are my ex student.\" Mrs Ash told Rae. \"Now take this letter and leave my office right this minute.\"\n\n\"Oh I see. This is very interesting.\" Rae said and then proceeded in placing her hand under her chin stroking her invisible long beard she doesn't have. \"That reminds me, Your only daughter normally goes to the witch library every evening, by 6pm on the dot. She doesn't miss a single day. She sits at the last row of the library chair which faces a window.\n\nIs it not that I am a stalker or something like that, please do not get that idea, but she normally follows the shortcut you secretly have behind your house. And today, I guess she told you that she will be coming late. She and her friend, Amila, have a project at hand. If you don't want to see your only daughter half to death, change that recommendation letter right now.\"\n\n\"I will report you to the Witches authority if you dare lay your filthy hands on my daughter.\" Mrs Ash said in anger to Rae who looked less concerned about her outburst.\n\n\"Go ahead Mrs Ash, report me and let us see between you and I who they will believe. Even till down, they didn't believe I beat up those students and rather accused you and the students for framing me. Once I cry, a stone hearted person will melt and believe me, so it's your choice madam.\"\n\nMrs Ash quickly opened her drawer and brought out a new piece of paper and started writing how wonderful Rae has been in her school:\n\nPrinciple Jake,\n\nThis is to inform you that your new transferred student, Rae Fey, is our best student so far in the witch school. Her brilliant brain doesn't have to be caged in this witch school, so that is why I am transferring her to you. She is of her best behavior and a down to earth girl, who helps a lot.\n\nI can assure you Jake, you will enjoy her stay in your school.\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nAsh.\n\nMrs Ash signed under it and gave the letter to Rae who read it with a satisfied nod, she gave it back to Ash who then put the letter in another envelope and gave it back to Rae.\n\nCollecting it with a smile. \"I never knew you loved me so much, Mrs Ash.\"\n\n\"Who will love someone like you, with your character, no one will ever settle down with you or think about loving you in the future. I only did that because of my daughter.\" Mrs Ash said as Rae laughed out. \"Your brilliant brain is so full of evil, if only your character is nice, it would suit that brain of yours, but no, the god's made you brilliant and gave you a nasty character.\"\n\n\"It is called wisdom Mrs Ash.\" Rae said and also took the other recommendations letter and smiled sweetly. \"If I later get to know you sent a letter apart from this one with me to Mr Jake, your daughter is a goner. Have a bountiful day, Mrs Ash.\" With that, Rae left her office.\n\nShe met Lillian who was waiting for her, she was concerned about what Rae might be doing to Ash. When the two minutes Rae had told her had elapsed, she wanted to go in, but stopped when she couldn't hear any shouts of help from Ash, so she concluded everything was going fine. If it was before, Ash would have screamed for help.\n\n\"Is everything okay?\" Lillian asked as soon as she saw Rae emerging out of the office.\n\n\"Yes granny, everything went normal.\" Rae answered and gave her the recommendation letter Mrs Ash has re-written. \"Here is the recommendation letter, she asked me to give you.\"\n\n\"Aww, that's so sweet of her.\" Lillian said as she collected the letter from her. \"Come on, let's go home.\" She added and made a portal open, she waited first for Rae to enter before she did. The portal closes behind her.\n\n***\n\n[Two days later]\n\nLillian who just came back from the witches meeting met Rae in her room, dancing. Rae was more of a tomboy than an actual girl. Her appearance appeared boyish.\n\nSeeing her jumping up and down on her bed without a care, brought back old memories which had long been buried.\n\nThanks to the 'Invisible Spell of Hidden' she had placed in her body that hides her true identity. She looks more like Avonmora when she was born, and carries her father Gene, she just hoped and prayed to the gods that Rae shouldn't encounter the priestess, if not, her true identity will be revealed. She also made a bracelet for her to wear always, the bracelet made her perform magic, which made everyone truly believed Rae was her granddaughter.\n\nHer pregnant daughter and husband, who was a hellhound, were attacked by some sea monsters on their way to pay her a surprise visit, her time for birth was drawing near. Before Lillian could come to their rescue, her daughter, husband and unborn child were dead. Magic could not revive the dead. It was at that time, the ball which held Rae also burst open.\n\nShe made everyone believed Rae's was her late daughter's child, which she saved before her death.\n\nLillian cleared her throat which drew Rae's attention to her. She jumped off the bed and landed near her.\n\n\"How did the meeting go? Did someone talk to you anyhow?\" Rae asked immediately.\n\n\"Nothing happened, I have submitted the recommendation letter to Jake, and you're to resume the new week coming by.\" Lillian replied to her.\n\n\"To tell you the truth granny, I'm no longer sure whether to go or not, I will be the new transferred girl.\" Rae said with a sigh.\n\n\"Come on. You're just afraid. That's normal. After all, it's a new school and I know how you must feel.\" Lillian said, trying to assure her granddaughter. \"You'll never find out if you love the school or not if you don't try first.\" Lillian said slowly as she brought Rae's closer to her and hug. \"The idea is to experience something first, and decide if it makes sense later. If you found out you don't love the school, tell me and I will see what I can do about it.\"\n\n“Yeah,” Rae said, returning her hug and staring thoughtfully at the ceiling. “I guess you're right.”\n\n\"So I have got everything that you would need for your new school.\" Lillian said as she cup Rae's face tenderly with her hands. \"This is a new school, there will be other Supernatural people going to that school. You will see fairies, hellhounds, vampires, wolves, etc, stay away from them and mingle with your fellow witches, and most importantly, stay away from a Wolf called Jaso- are you even listening?\" Lillian asked as Rae began humming a tune.\n\n\"Yes granny, I know what you want to say already.\" Rae said as she kissed the side cheek of Lillian. \"You don't have to worry about me granny. I am not looking for any trouble.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n***\n\n[On the mountain top]\n\nTamara entered her cave and proceeded to where her magic books are kept, she barely made it inside when she stopped in her tracks. Standing in front of her was the man in water form. She bowed before him.\n\n\"Enough of your bowing Tamara, it's been a thousand years since the search for the last mermaid begun, and still yet you have not come across her or the one who gave birth to her.\"\n\n\"My Lord, it is not as simple as you think, I don't know where to find her, but I can assure you, that I am going to find the last mermaid before this year runs by.\" Tamara assured.\n\n\"That was what you have been saying each year. Tharollin has almost gotten to where my bones are being kept, so I need to drink the last mermaid blood before Tharollin reaches the bones.\"\n\n\"I will try harder my Lord, I just know this year won't pass without me finding where the last mermaid is.\"\n\n\"Better, for I am losing my patience with you.\"\n\n***\n\n[School day]\n\nThe day for Rae to start her new school has arrived. She quickly took her bath and made her food appear before her from the kitchen and ate it fast.\n\nPutting on her favorite black leather trousers with a white vase. Taking her black jacket and wearing it, putting on her matching black boots. She came out of her room and went to meet Lillian.\n\n\"I am ready, granny.\" She announced as she saw Lillian in her study table.\n\n\"Don't cause any trouble Rae, today is your first day in school, first impression matters a lot.\" Lillian told her and made a portal opened.\n\n\"Of course, granny, have faith in your granddaughter.\" Rae said as Lillian kissed her forehead tenderly.\n\nLillian shrugged her shoulders. \"I am just telling you. Now go, I want you to be among the early birds.\"\n\nRae smiled and entered the portal.\n\n\"I will be checking on you from time to time. Don't forget to alert me when school has closed.\" Lillian said before the portal closed.\n\nThe portal opened at the front of the Supernatural school gate and closes once she stepped out. She saw other witches doing the same.\n\nFirst impression matters.\n\nRemoving her jacket she wore, she flipped it over to her left shoulder and screamed out loud. \"I AM STARTING A NEW SCHOOL.\"",

        "content": "'I'm unpredictable, I never know where I'm going until I get there, I'm so random, I'm always growing, learning, changing, I'm never the same person twice. But one thing you can be sure of about me; is I will always do exactly what I want to do. I'm not stubborn. My way is just better.'\n\n***\n\nHer sudden screams draw the attention of all the students outside the gate to her. The students around her started whispering amongst themselves. Rae felt satisfied.\n\nFeeling like a princess now that everyone's attention has been drawn to her, ignoring the whispering going on around her, she kept her head high and entered the school compound as if she owned it.\n\nThe school was large with various separate buildings in it.\n\nShe scanned the environment and noticed some students were looking at her and others were ignoring her. Raising her Jacket upwards and rolling it round her head, she screamed out loud once again. \"Hello People, I said I am new here!\"\n\nShe smirked when she finally got all their attention.\n\n\"We don't make such noise here, didn't your parents or guardian tell you that?\" A male voice said behind her back and made to grab her on her shoulder.\n\nThe unexpected happened.\n\nBefore his hand would make contact with Rae's shoulder, without turning, she held his hand and twisted it and with inhuman strength she doesn't even know she has, she flipped the man to her front, who landed on the floor in a heavy thud.\n\nStill twisting the full grown man hand hard, no matter how hard the man tried to remove his twisted hand from the iron fist hand of the girl, he couldn't, the sound of a bone dislocated was heard. \"I don't like people touching me unless I permit them too.\" Rae said her voice coming out in double.\n\nBy now, they have attracted the whole students and teachers' attention to them, some of them, who tried to separate them, couldn't when Rae made eye contact with them. The sudden fear that shook those teachers coming made them rushed back and someone, a female witch, quickly teleported to tell Principle Jack what happened.\n\nHe soon came out and was shocked by what he saw, the vice principal of the Supernaturals was pinned to the ground by a student. He saw how his vice principal was trying to get away from the girl who held him but to no avail. He was helpless against the girl.\n\n\"What is going on?\" Jack asked as he advanced towards them. He nearly halted in his footsteps when Rae turned to stare at him coldly, nearly, but he is the principal of the school and a werewolf to top it all. \"I asked a question, what is going on!?\" He asked again when he was standing in front of Rae.\n\n\"If you don't mind your business, you will soon join him.\" Rae answered, twisting the man on the ground hand the more.\n\n\"Did you know who you are talking to?\" Jack asked folding his arms behind him, her character reminds him of two people. But her eyes when she had looked at him earlier on, reminded him of someone he knew from the past, someone who he couldn't remember.\n\n\"And who the hell are you!?\" Rae shouted ignoring the loud gasps coming out from the students and teachers around them when she asked that question. By their shocked look display on their faces, they know who the man asking her stupid question is, does she care? Hell no.\n\n\"I am Jack, the principal of the Supernaturals.\" Jack introduced himself \"And you are?\"\n\nIt was as if the words he said were magic to the girl in front of him, because she quickly left the man she had pinned down, stood up and smiled at him.\n\n\"I am Rae.\" She answered.\n\n\"Rae what?\" Jack asked to be sure it was not the student he was expecting. He silently prayed to the gods that this shouldn't be his new transferred student. But it seems the gods were against him when he heard the next words omitting out from her mouth.\n\n\"Rae Fey, the one who was supposed to start this school today.\" Rae replied, smiling widely.\n\nMeanwhile, the man she had thrown to the ground, stood up, cleaning up the dirt from his clothes as he stares at the girl who just disgraced him in front of the whole school, holding his twisted hand and trying not to show his pains.\n\n\"If she is the new transferred student we are expecting, then we don't need her, the two we have is enough for us, we don't need a third one.\" The man grunted out.\n\n\"She's Lillian's granddaughter Rick, we can't chase her out when her previous school gave her such a good recommendation.\" Jack said, shaking his Sandy brown hair head. He faces Rae, \"Apologize to Rick,\" he added.\n\n\"Why will I? He touched my shoulder, so I am not apologizing.\" Rae responded boldly.\n\n\"He is the vice principal of this school Rae, so yes, it is necessary for you to respect him and this should be the last time it repeats itself.\"\n\n\"Fine, sorry, jackass.\" Rae said, rolling her eyes at them.\n\n\"Rick I don't know why they love picking on you, she is just like them, at least she apologized unlike those two.\" Jack said, almost smiling. \"Go and see the school nurse to set your bones, everyone should go back to what he or she is doing!\" Jack shouted the last part to the students, who went back to what they were doing, he faced Rae. \"And you young lady, you're coming with me.\"\n\nWithout waiting for a reply, Jack left, going back to his office.\n\nRae snorted at Rick and quickly hurried up to meet Jack.\n\nEntering his office, she sat down and placed her legs on his table.\n\nJack stared at her in surprise, the girl had some guts. \"Let's start with the school rules, first remove your legs from my table.\"\n\n\"Why Mr Jack? I love keeping it like this, got a problem with that?\" Rae asked with raised eyebrows at Jack.\n\n\"You sounded just like them, but anyways, Mrs Ash didn't mention that you are a fighter, she only made mention of how good you have been to her school.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's me, full of surprises.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Jack said and clapped his hands once, a female teacher who's a witch, appeared right next to Jack.\n\n\"What can I do for you Jack?\" The witch asked.\n\n\"Please give Rae a copy of the school rules.\"\n\nThe witch nodded her head and whispered some words silently, a large scroll appeared right in front of Rae and landed on her lap. \"That's your own copy of the school rules, go through it and abide by it.\" The witch said to Rae who took it and opened the scroll. The witch disappeared.\n\nA frown appeared on Rae's face when she opened the scroll and rolled down towards the principal door. \"Are you kidding me, this is so fucking long and has plenty rules.\" Rae said with wide eyes as she stared at the scroll in her hands.\n\n\"Yes, there are 1,000, rules in it that you must go through and obey every single one of them, every student in this Supernaturals school has a copy of that in your hand.\"\n\nRae didn't say anything, she quickly use a spell to refold the scroll back. \"Is there anything else you want to bore me with?\"\n\nJack smiled at her. \"This is not your former school where only witches and wizards attend, we have all kinds of Supernaturals in this school.\" He added, still smiling.\n\n\"Anything else I need to know?\" Rae asked less concerned.\n\n\"Just keep out of trouble.\" Jack said and stood up. \"Wait a minute, I will be back.\" He told her and left his office, he soon returned with a girl of Rae's height. She was beautiful, her hair was dark brown and her eyes were deep brown in color. She looked like the shy type.\n\n\"Who is this?\" Rae asked as she saw the girl with Jack who was trying not to stare at her.\n\n\"She will be the one taking you to all your classes until you are familiar with them.\" Jack replied.\n\n\"Did I ask you that I need a babysitter oh high and mighty principal?\"\n\nSmiling. \"Yes, since today is your first day in this school, I don't want you to get lost so yes, Sarah will show you to all your classes and luckily for you, you are all in her class. Class will soon start, hop out of my office right now.\"\n\nRae didn't say anything, she got up and went out of the office with Sarah following behind. She stopped and turned to face the silent girl following her. \"I thought you were the one to show me my class and not me showing you?\"\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\n\"Now lead the way.\"\n\nAs she followed Sarah, she noticed how the students kept staring at her as if she had two heads. Stopping in front of a student. \"Why are you staring at me, is there something on my face you wanna tell me?\" Rae asked the boy she caught staring at her.\n\n\"N--n..no, sorry.\" the guy stuttered at his response.\n\n\"Good.\" Rae said and continued with Sarah.\n\n\"So Sarah, what kind of Supernatural creature are you?\" Rae decided to ask the quiet girl.\n\n\"Umm..am a Centaur.\" Sarah answered.\n\nA Centaur is a creature which is half-woman and half-horse.\n\n\"Wow, a Centaur?\" Rae asked, Sarah nodded her head.\n\n\"Yes.\" Stopping in front of a class, which was noisy. \"This is our first class, history.\"\n\n\"Okay Sarah.\"\n\nThey both entered the class together and the noise stopped once they saw who stepped in with Sarah.\n\nThe news of how she nearly beat up Rick, has gone round the school.\n\nIgnoring them all, she quietly made her way to the back of the class which surprisingly seemed empty. Surprising because all of them avoid the back seats.\n\nSeating in one of the empty chairs and making herself at home, she waited for the stupid history teacher to make his or her apprearance. Placing her hands at the back of her head, she closed her eyes and started singing an old witch song her grandmother had once taught her.\n\nThe class suddenly got quiet once again.\n\nRae heard someone coming towards her but she did as if she didn't hear it and continued humming her song.\n\n\"What are you doing here? Can't you see that I am the only one who sits in the back row?\" A male voice demanded.\n\nOpening her eyes to see who was it, she saw a very handsome guy whose nose kept flaring out in a funny way in anger as he stared at her. Is that red?\n\n\"And who are you?\" Rae asked the handsome guy.\n\n\"I am Jorkallun and you are sitting in my territory. I will advise you to find another row and occupy it.\" Jorkallun said with anger laced in each word.\n\n\"Last I remember, you don't own the school so you have no right in telling me where I should sit, pretty boy.\" Rae said. She suddenly found it strange that everywhere became quiet, the once noisy huge school all went silent as if waiting for something to happen.\n\n\"You!\" Jorkallun snarled furiously. In perfect counterpoint to his anger, his already brilliant red hair went from hot to flaming - literally.",

        "title": "Book 1: Three Million Dollars for Me?",
        "content": "BOOK 1: CHOSEN AS THE BREEDER\n\nShe never wanted to be a Breeder—but her parents sold her anyway.\n\nThe Alpha King is searching for an heir in the most unorthodox way: whoever can impregnate the Breeder first will be crowned the next king. Which means Rose is sent to the castle with one purpose—to submit to four Alphas or risk shaming her entire pack.\n\nAt first, she’s terrified. But then she meets them.\n\nMark is intelligent.\n\nEli is sweet.\n\nReece is debonair.\n\nAnd Tristan is a horny goofball.\n\nWith each of them, Rose feels something real—something worth fighting for. And they seem to want forever with her, too.\n\nBut in the castle, nothing is as simple as it seems. Especially when the king’s cousin, Emily, declares she will be the next Luna—no matter who she has to destroy to get it.\n\nCan Rose and her Alphas claim their happily ever after… or will love be the first casualty in the fight for the crown?\n\n***\n\nRose\n\n“Three million dollars is an awful lot of money for only a few months’ worth of work.”\n\nQuiet voices filter into my ears from the living room, and I pause to listen, hoping that my parents are not discussing me.\n\nThen… I hear my name, and I know that they are talking about me. Again.\n\n“Rose is a fine young woman,” my mother is saying. “Any Alpha would be happy to have her.”\n\n“I know, I know,” my father agrees. “I definitely think it’s worth it for us to send her.”\n\nAn Alpha having me? I don’t know what this is about, but at least it’s not about a job.\n\nThe last time I caught my parents talking about me was right before I found out that they’d gotten me a job at the sewage treatment plant of the pack neighboring ours. Not exactly the glamorous job the daughter of an Alpha would expect. But I’d taken it and worked there for a few years to help my family with their enormous debt.\n\n“I know that it would be the answer to all of our prayers, Karen,” my father adds, before confessing, “But I’m worried she won’t be able to do what they want her to do. After all, our little Rose isn’t that bright. She can be a real idiot sometimes. She might not even know which hole to put it in.”\n\nMy father’s harsh words sting as I try to figure out what they are talking about. Do what?! I couldn’t help but think about all of the times he had called me names. Idiot isn’t that bad compared to some of the other things he’s called me. Still… It hurts, and I realize that tears are stinging my eyes.\n\nWhy can’t my parents just love me like the other kids I know who have parents that love them unconditionally?\n\nMy father, Alpha Howard, and my mother, Luna Karen, are not very good at keeping the books up to date for the pack. That’s because the money isn’t there. And everyone knows they’ve dipped their hands into the coffers to pay for projects at home.\n\nWhen our natural resources began to dry up a few years ago, my parents were no longer able to hide the fact that the pack was in massive debt–and that they’ve been the ones spending most of the money.\n\nSo… I’d done what I could to help them, and I would do it again now if I had to. My pack means so much to me, despite how awful my parents can be, someone has to take responsibility for saving the pack.\n\nI kept listening, pretty confident that I wouldn’t get sent to a sewage treatment plant. I’d ended up getting fired for throwing up on the job too many times…. Go figure.\n\n“This is different than last time!” My mother sounds annoyed, and even though I can’t see them through the crack in the doors where I am listening, I can practically see her rolling her eyes.\n\n“She’s not going to throw up all over the Alphas!”\n\n“You hope,” my dad says, and that catches me off guard. Before I can think too much my dad continues, “But there will surely be daughters of Alphas and Betas from all over the kingdom trying to get this position. Why in the world would they ever choose Rose? She’s hopeless!”\n\nSo this is about a job. I try not to frown at my father’s lack of faith in me. Even though I don’t even know exactly what they’re talking about. Maybe he’s right to feel that way. Maybe I’m not capable of doing whatever it is they are talking about.\n\nThe idea that I’m about to embark on another awful job makes my stomach twist into knots. As unbearable as it is to live with my cruel parents, at least here, I know what to expect. It’s not as if I can just leave. I am the Alpha’s daughter. If I left my home before I married, it would make everyone question what was going on here and destroy the pack’s reputation; my parents would never allow it.\n\nBut the way they are talking at the moment makes my palms sweaty and my head feel dizzy. I wish I could’ve left a long time ago.\n\nI need to know what it is before I form an opinion, but I’m too scared to move forward because I know I will be punished for eavesdropping. I adjust slightly on my feet, and the floorboards squeak, which should’ve let them know that I was there, but they keep talking.\n\nOur house is so old and rundown, they don’t even notice that I’m the one making the noise and not just the foundation settling–again.\n\n“We will send her. I have no doubt she’ll find a way to screw it up, but at least we will have given it a try. It’s better than letting her continue to stay here and mess our lives up even more,” my mother declares.\n\n“Fine,” my father agrees. “I’m just saying… don’t get your hopes up. Chances are, she will fail us with this as she has with everything else she’s ever been asked to do on our behalf.”\n\nI feel my heart drop into my stomach, a lump that’s barely beating.\n\nIs that really what my parents think of me?\n\nWhatever it is they are sending me to do, it sounds terrifying. Maybe they are right and I can’t do it. I do fail so frequently at whatever they ask me to do. Their standards are unreasonable. At least, that’s what I tell myself.\n\nThere are other Alphas involved, so that means their standards will be just as high as my father’s.\n\nNo, I can’t do this. I want to run and hide! No matter what it is, it’s just too terrible for someone like me to even give it a try. I need to get away from here–\n\nI hear footsteps coming in this direction and realize I need to hide the fact that I’ve been eavesdropping on them. I back up several steps to the sink and turn on the tap, grabbing a glass out of the cabinet and filling it, like I’m just getting a drink of water.\n\n“Oh, there you are, dear,” my mom says, the word “dear” coming out of her lips like she had to force it. “We were hoping to speak to you. Wait–you weren’t listening were you?”\n\nI turn and look at them, taking a sip of my water before setting the glass down on the counter. “No, I wasn’t listening,” I lie. She seems to buy it. “What is it, Mom?” I ask curtly.\n\n“Well, there’s a job opening up at the castle. King Gene is looking for a very special young lady to fill a specific role, and we think that you would be the perfect candidate for this new job.” My father smiles, like he really feels that way, even though I’ve just heard them both say that they think I can’t handle this job either.\n\n“What job is it?” I ask.\n\nMy parents exchange an uneasy glance, and once again, I am reminded of the sewage treatment plant.\n\nSurely, it can’t be anything that shitty.\n\n“Well, honey,” my mom says, “it’s a very important job.”\n\nWhy are they stalling? Why can’t they just spit it out? “Yes, you said that,” I remind her.\n\n“The king is trying to decide which of the Alphas will take over his position as king, once he retires. Since he has no children, he’s decided to appoint one of four Alphas to become the next Alpha King.” My dad smiles, like he thinks he might get the job.\n\nThat will not be the case. “All right…” I sigh. “What does that have to do with me?”\n\nAnother uneasy exchange of glances passes between them. “The Alpha who takes over the throne will need to have an heir,” my mom explains. “And… that means… they need… a Breeder.”\n\nThe water I swallowed a moment ago seems to have come back up, and I find myself choking. No one asks if I’m okay or tries to comfort me as I attempt to breathe. Eventually, I recover enough to ask, “A Breeder? You want me to be a baby making machine for an alpha?”\n\nI can hardly believe what I’m hearing. I’m a virgin! I’ve never even kissed a man before! I’ve been saving myself in hopes of finding a true love match that will become a fated mate, but from what I’m hearing, none of that matters now.\n\n“That’s right, dear,” my father says. “The pay is excellent, and it would give our pack some much-needed status in the kingdom.”\n\n“But what about me?” I ask, annoyed. “You’re okay with essentially selling my virginity to some random Alpha?”\n\n“Honey, it’s not like that,” my mom says. “It’s an honor. A lot of Alphas and Betas are sending their daughters to try for the position. We are only hoping that you’ll be the best suited.”\n\nI shake my head. “No, please.”\n\nMy father’s hand lashes out and slaps me hard across the face. I recoil as my cheek lights on fire. I should’ve known better than to tell him no. This isn’t the first time he’s slapped me. “Don’t you tell me no, little bitch!”\n\nI step back, out of his reach. “Mom, Dad, please! You know I’ve always done everything you’ve asked me to do, but you can’t seriously be asking me to do this! To sell myself to an Alpha I don’t even know?”\n\nMy dad takes a deep breath through his nose. “I think you’re misunderstanding a couple of things, Rose,” my father says. “First of all, we’re not asking you to do anything. We are telling you. You’ll leave tomorrow.”\n\n“But Dad!” I begin. He holds up a hand to stop me, and I’m not sure if he might strike me if I don’t stop talking. He has done so before.\n\n“The other thing you’re misunderstanding, Rose,” he continues, “is that you will not be a Breeder for a random Alpha.”\n\nI take a deep breath, hoping that means I won’t be a Breeder at all. “I won’t?” I ask worriedly.\n\n“No, daughter,” my mother says. “There are four Alphas, and they’ve already been selected, so it isn’t random at all!”\n\nMy spirits fall as I realize my misunderstanding had nothing to do with not having to become a Breeder. That is still the job they are giving me. It’s just the random part I was apparently wrong about.\n\n“So… I’ll be assigned to one of the Alphas as a Breeder?” I ask them.\n\nAgain, my parents shake their heads. “No, that’s not it at all,” my father says, clearly growing agitated again.\n\nI lean back against the kitchen counter, feeling myself grow dizzy and weak in the knees from so much discussion about such a terrifying subject. “What is it then?” I ask.\n\nThey have an internal debate about who has to answer that question, and it is my mom who draws the short stick. With a deep breath, she says, “Rose, you won’t be a Breeder to one of the Alphas. You’ll be a Breeder to all four.”\n\n“All four?” The words echo around in my head, but I can’t absorb them. It just doesn’t seem possible. My parents are willing to sell me to all four of them?\n\nI’ll have to have sex with four different men?\n\n“No!” The word escapes my lips before I can even think about it, and once again, I feel the sharp blow of my father’s hand contacting my cheek.\n\nThe stinging inside of me is worse than the smarting in my cheek, though. I can’t do this….\n\nThat lightheaded feeling envelopes me, and the next thing I know, the world is turning dark at the edges, and I find myself giving way to gravity.\n\nThe last thing I hear is my mom saying, “Rose, really?” and then the world goes black.",

        "content": "Rose\n\nThe journey to Castle Dark Forest takes about two days. We travel by train, me and the escort that King Gene has sent to make sure that I arrive at the castle safely. Some of the packs are in a bit of an uproar over the way that King Gene has chosen the four Alphas to be considered to replace him, and there’s a possibility that they might be willing to take their outrage out on the women coming to the castle.\n\nThis entire journey all a little overwhelming, and I still haven’t gotten my mind wrapped around why I’m even going to the castle. The last thing on earth I want to do is be a Breeder–not even for one Alpha, let alone four strangers.\n\nMy hands are trembling, and my stomach is in knots as I swallow back bile. I can’t believe I’m even here!\n\nMy shoulder still hurts from where my father pushed me onto the train, right before the door closed.\n\nThis is the last place in the world I ever wanted to be!\n\nBut here I am, sitting next to Delta Sebastian, my escort, on a train speeding toward the castle. I know that there are other women on board who are going for the same purpose, but I haven’t met any of them yet. The escorts all think it would be best if we wait until we get to the castle to get to know one another.\n\nIf we even have the chance to. After all, only one of us will be staying. We’re all essentially competitors.\n\nI overhear a conversation between two passengers in front of us. “I suppose some of these pretty girls must be going to the castle to audition for that dreadful Breeder position,” the woman says.\n\nThe man sitting next to her, who I assume is her husband, says, “Yes, this is the third train ride I’ve been on this month where there’s been a bunch of hopeful young women about to have their dreams shattered.”\n\nThat’s true. My dreams will indeed be shattered if I am selected.\n\nBut I look around the train and see lots of girls seemingly much more confident than I am. Bleached blondes, fierce redheads, girls with satiny dark hair…. I’d go as far to say that they’re more beautiful than me, and because of that, I’m hopeful that one of them will be chosen, not me.\n\nTo be fair, I am not ugly, but I’m not beautiful. At least, no one has ever told me that I am. I have blonde, straight hair, blue eyes, and a decent figure. My nose is a little too long for my face, I think, and there’s a small gap between my two front teeth. When I look at these other girls, I see no flaws whatsoever.\n\nMy eyes land on a redhead in a green dress. She smiles at me, and I manage a smile back, but I’m too nervous to keep looking at her. She’s way prettier than I am, which makes me feel slightly better.\n\nEveryone else seems happy about this possibility, though a few girls look a little nervous, but no one looks like they are on the verge of throwing up, like I am.\n\nThe redhead is so beautiful, she’ll definitely get the job before I will, which is reassuring, because as much as my parents seem to hate me, at least I would legitimately lose instead of just having to run away to avoid the contest.\n\nBut then… maybe that is my best option. I look around the train, wondering if there’s any way I can just hurl myself out one of these windows. We are going too fast for that. That doesn’t mean I won’t continue to consider running away if the chance presents itself.\n\nWhatever is out there in the world, it has to be better than this.\n\nWe arrive at the train station near the castle, and we are escorted to SUVs to make the trip to the king’s home, which we can see in the distance. Our escorts are still with us, so we try to keep chatting minimal. I find myself sitting right next to the same redhead. She seems nice. There’s a girl with blonde curly hair across from me, and she doesn’t look so welcoming.\n\nThe castle grows larger and larger as we travel toward it. I can hardly believe how huge it is.\n\nMade of stone, it juts out of the ground and has to be at least ten stories tall in places. With turrets and catwalks on the roof, it looks daunting as the sun reflects off of its surface.\n\nWe go through a guarded gate, and the vehicle stops out front. I wait my turn to get out and then follow the other girls inside.\n\nWe are led to a waiting room, the room lined up with chairs.\n\n“Take a seat,” a woman in a black suit with a no-nonsense face, tells us. “The king will interview each of you, and then you’ll go for your examination.” She turns and walks away.\n\nMy eyes widen. Examination? There’s a test?\n\nOne of the blondes I saw on the train leans over to a brunette and whispers, “What kind of a test do we have to take?”\n\nThe other girl laughs. “Our medical examinations, silly.” She rolls her eyes, and I am glad I didn’t ask the stupid question.\n\nOur escorts have left us, so there are just the twelve of us in the waiting area now. We can talk freely, but I’m not sure I want to. It’s not as if we will all be staying here. Only one of us will get the job, and the others will leave. Not to mention, this isn’t even the first group of us–apparently. So who knows if it will even be someone from this group?\n\n“I’m so nervous,” the redhead whispers to me. “I think I’m going to be sick.”\n\nI think about when I threw up at the sewage treatment plant. “Yeah, me, too.”\n\n“I mean… it’ll make such a huge difference to my family if I get this,” she adds.\n\nI try not to stare at her. I don’t really care about how much this will help my family–I don’t want the job. I silently hope she gets it.\n\nThe girl on my other side has brown hair and wide brown eyes. “I know,” she says, as if the redhead had been speaking to her. “I just want to get this part over with and find out what’s going to happen!”\n\n“Why don’t they just choose four of us anyway, one breeder for each Alpha?” asks the redhead to whoever was listening. “There are plenty of women here to find four suitable Breeders.”\n\n“That wouldn’t be fair!” says the brunette. “What if one were more fertile than the others? Since the first to breed will be the new Alpha King, it’s only fair to just have one woman!”\n\nThey all break into a discussion until the door in front of us opens, and I realize one of us is about to be called in to meet the king.\n\nLooking around the group, I try to guess who it will be.\n\n“Rose Forrest?” the woman in the black suit calls.\n\nI am first?\n\nI am first!\n\nAll eyes are on me as I stand, straightening out the red dress I am wearing. My eyes dart to the exit. Do I have enough time to run out that door instead of going into the king’s office?\n\nNot in these damn shoes!\n\nSwallowing back my fear, I walk to the door. I try not to trip over my silver heels. I’m not used to wearing them. My parents insisted that I wear something like this, but I’m used to sneakers and jeans.\n\nI walk into a large office and see an older man sitting behind a huge desk. He has gray and brown hair and a tight-lipped expression on his face, no smile. I bow as I’ve been taught. “Your Majesty,” I say.\n\n“Sit, girl,” he says to me, and I walk to one of the chairs across from him. “What is your name?”\n\nI tell him. “Rose Forrest, sir, from Elm pack.”\n\n“And how old are you?”\n\nI swallow hard. “Twenty, sir.”\n\n“And have you found your wolf?”\n\nI shake my head. “Not yet, sir.”\n\nHe looks disappointed. I’m not twenty-one yet. If I haven’t met my wolf by then, I will be worried.\n\n“Why are you here, dear?”\n\nMy parents prepared an answer for me, but it isn’t the truth, so it will be all jumbled if I try to recite it. So I tell the truth. “My parents wanted me to come, sir.”\n\n“Your parents? You don’t want to be here?”\n\n“Uh… it is an honor to meet you, Your Majesty, but I am here because my parents wanted me to come. They believe this will be a great honor. Which it will be!” I add. “But… they are the ones who are most excited about the potential.”\n\nI wish I could tell him how awful I am, but I don’t know if my parents will get information about my answers, so I have to be careful not to sound like I’m trying too hard not to be chosen.\n\nHe stares at me for a long moment, his dark eyes seemingly unimpressed. “Have you been with a man before?”\n\nI shake my head. “No, sir. Never.” My cheeks flame up at the question. I hope he doesn’t ask me any more intimate questions.\n\nHe looks down at his desk where he has a list of questions. He asks me, “Have you found your fated mate? Or do you have a man at home that you are in love with?”\n\n“No, Your Majesty,” I tell him. “I have no fated mate, nor am I in love with any man. I’ve never even been on a date with a man.”\n\nI realize once the words have escaped my lips that I’ve spoken too much. I hope he thinks there’s something wrong with me. I can’t tell him I don’t have time to date because I’m too busy trying to earn money for my parents. I certainly won’t mention the sewage treatment plant.\n\nHe looks me over, and I feel myself turning red in the face. A moment later, he says, “You may go.”\n\n“Thank you, Your Majesty,” I say, standing. I bow and back out of the room as I’ve been taught.\n\nWhen I’m in the hallway, the woman in the black suit says, “Head straight down that hallway to the nurse.”\n\n“Yes, ma’am,” I say. I hazard one last look over at the other girls. The redhead smiles at me, but I can barely get my mouth to cooperate enough to smile back at her.\n\nI head down the hallway to the nurse, dreading the examination that will be next. If the king doesn’t like me, why even bother with this?\n\nMy mind is swimming as I think about what will happen to me next. The last thing I want is some stranger’s hands all over my body.\n\nTears cloud my eyes as I continue to walk. I wipe them away, but more just replace them.\n\nWhy can’t I just go home?\n\nWith tears clouding my vision, and terror beginning to well up inside of me, I’m not paying attention to where I’m going, and after a bit, I start to wonder if maybe I passed the examination room.\n\nI turn around and look back, but I don’t see anything. When I turn around again, I begin quickening my pace, until suddenly, I collide into a solid wall.\n\nMade of muscle.",

        "content": "Rose\n\nWhatever I’ve run into, it’s solid as a rock and jars me backward, almost making me fall flat onto the stone floor of the castle.\n\nBut at the last moment, as I am tumbling backward, a hand stretches out and grabs my arm, keeping me from toppling over and pulling me back to my feet.\n\nWith tears still in my eyes, it’s hard for me to see what’s happening. I wipe them away with my free hand and look up into a pair of blue eyes so intense, I think I might have wandered into another realm. I’ve never seen a shifter with eyes like his before.\n\n“Are you all right?” he says, but he’s not the one who is holding on to me. Next to him is another man with rich chocolate-brown eyes and a concerned look on his handsome face. His fingers are wrapped around my upper arm, and his other hand is extended, in case he should need to help me find my footing again, I assume.\n\nI’m fine now, though. Just shocked. “Y-yes,” I manage to eke out, looking from one of them to the other. Never have I ever seen even one man this handsome before, and now I’m staring at two of them.\n\nThe one with the blue eyes is a bit taller than the other, with sandy blond hair and an intense stare. They are both muscle-bound, but I would say he’s a little leaner than the other one. My brown-eyed rescuer has dark hair, a closely trimmed beard, and mustache. He is a little shorter than the other man, but his shoulders are wider.\n\nBoth of them are made of pure muscle and dressed like royalty in nice suit pants and white-button down shirts. The blond has on a matching black jacket. Their suits probably cost more than my house.\n\n“Sorry,” the one I’ve run into, the one with blue eyes, says.\n\n“It’s okay,” I say back to him. He’s clearly a man of few words. He seems nice, though. I am surprised at how nice people are here–for the most part. Not everyone, though.\n\nThey are nicer than my parents… so far.\n\n“Do you need help with something?” the other one asks. He gives me a polite smile, and for a moment, I think he might be checking me out. His eyes drop down to my chest and then lower, making it to the floor before they slowly filter back up.\n\n“Uh… I’m looking for the… medical examination room,” I stammer as he finally releases my arm. My bicep suddenly feels cold without his warm fingers there, and I can feel little pulses of electricity leftover from his touch.\n\n“Down there,” blue eyes says, pointing over his shoulder. So I haven’t gone far enough.\n\n“Thank you,” I manage to say. I want to speak more, but I can’t get any more words out.\n\n“You look upset,” the dark-haired one notices. “Is something troubling you, miss?”\n\nHe’s so polite, it takes me by surprise. Even though my father is an Alpha, I’m not used to being treated like I matter. “Oh, uh, I’m fine,” I admit. “Just… nervous, I guess.”\n\n“You here for the position?” the blond asks.\n\nHe doesn’t have to specify which position. We all know what he’s referring to. I nod my head.\n\n“Cool,” the other one says. My eyes go to his face, and he is grinning at me. It is a lopsided grin that might look creepy on some guys, but when it is someone so attractive wearing that expression, it is endearing.\n\nI want to ask him what he means by that. Why is it cool? Why does he care why I am here? He looks like he must be someone important, but I don’t dare try to guess who. He could be a Beta or one of the king’s advisors for all I know.\n\n“I apologize for running into you, sir,” I say to the man who has likely left an imprint of his pec on my forehead.\n\nHe snickers. “No problem. It’s Mark.”\n\n“Mark?” I repeat, like my mouth has never formed those sounds in one string before.\n\n“That’s right.” He is still smiling at me, but it seems like something I’ve said or done has amused him.\n\n“And I’m Tristan,” the other one says.\n\n“Hi.” That’s all I’m capable of speaking. I feel lightheaded, either by their handsomeness or because I’d hit my head moments before. I can’t tell. Maybe both.\n\nThey exchange amused expressions before Tristan asks me, “What is your name, sweetie?”\n\nSweetie? I don’t think anyone has ever called me that before. It sounds nice when he says it, though. “Uh….” My name won’t come out of my mouth. It’s as if I don’t have one.\n\n“You do have a name don’t you?” Tristan asks me, and they both chuckle again.\n\n“Yes,” I finally get out. “It’s Rose. I’m Rose.” I can feel my face turning the same shade as my dress. How can I not remember my own stupid name? My father’s right. I am an idiot.\n\n“That’s a beautiful name,” Tristan says. “Like a flower.”\n\nI arch an eyebrow. I’ve never heard of a Rose flower, but I’ll take the compliment. “Thank you, sir.”\n\nHis smile widens. “And you’re so polite, too. Well, Rose, we won’t keep you. I’m sure you’re in a rush to get this examination over. But it sure was nice to meet you.”\n\nI nod. “You as well.” I look from one of them to the other. Mark nods at me, too, like he agrees.\n\nStill feeling flushed, I step around them and continue on my way, but I only make it a few steps down the hallway before I’m compelled to turn and look back over my shoulder at them.\n\nThey haven’t moved, and they are both staring at me. Tristan waves. I don’t lift my hand, though. I’m so embarrassed at being caught peeking! I turn around again and rush off, hoping my face isn’t as red as it feels. My cheeks are scorching.\n\nAs I walk, I ponder who those two gentlemen might be. They were so handsome and well-bred. I have to wonder. Is it possible they might’ve been two of the Alphas?\n\n“Surely not,” I mutter to myself. Alphas wouldn’t want to have anything to do with someone like me. The fact that they seemed to think I was attractive is astonishing to say the least. None of the boys back home ever looked at me twice. But then… I was the Alpha's daughter, and they probably feared my father.\n\nI arrive at the examination room and pause outside, taking a deep breath.\n\nI don’t want to go in. The idea of some stranger probing my body, touching me in places I’ve never even touched myself… it’s horrifying.\n\nFor once in my life, home seems like a better place than where I am.\n\nI look around. Is there any place for me to run to? Maybe I could hide and then just hop back on the train when it leaves the castle.\n\nBut no… I have no choice but to move forward. My parents are expecting this of me, and even if I don’t feel that I owe them anything after the way they’ve treated me, I’ve agreed to do this for my pack. I just don’t understand why it is always me who has to take on these horrible situations for them.\n\nFor my pack’s sake. That’s at least enough to keep me motioning through the steps.\n\nSomehow, I manage to get my feet moving forward again, and I walk through the doors, into the examination room where everything is white, sterile, and smells like bleach.\n\nAll thoughts of the two handsome gentlemen are brushed aside, and all I can think about is how badly I want to get out of here. I don’t want to go home, back to my awful parents, but I do want to leave.\n\nThe thought of running away comes to my mind again. Would living on the streets be so bad compared to living with my parents? Somehow, I doubt it.\n\nBut I can’t get away now… so I have to continue.\n\nA woman dressed in a nurse’s uniform comes out from behind a desk. “Ah, there you are!” she says, pursing her lips at me. “We’ve been waiting for nearly ten minutes.”\n\n“I-I’m sorry,” I stammer. So much for everyone here being nice.\n\n“Did you get lost, dear?” she asks, and when she says “dear” it does not sound like a term of endearment.\n\nI nod. “Yes, sorry,” I mutter.\n\nShe shakes her head at me. “It’s really not that difficult. Just down the hall from the king’s office.”\n\n“Yes, ma’am,” I stutter.\n\nShe shakes her head at me. “Rose Forrest?”\n\nI nod again. It’s better than having to speak since my words have been failing me today.\n\n“Very well. Go into examination room two, strip down, and put on a gown. Your doctor will be in shortly.”\n\nAgain, I find my eyes fixated and my feet unable to move. I am staring at her like she’s just told me to cut my own head off with a butter knife.\n\n“Well?” she demands. “Are you stupid or hard of hearing?” she asks, reaching out and grabbing my shoulder and giving me a shove.\n\nOn my wobbly heels, I am not prepared for this, and I careen forward, almost face-planting on the stone floor. Somehow, I manage to catch myself on the wall before I fall and knock my teeth out.\n\nShe grumbles, “May as well take that one off of the list.” Then, raising her voice she yells, “Go!”\n\nI figure out how to get my feet untangled and moving again, making my way down the hallway. I can’t remember which room she said to go into, though, so I head for the first one and hope that’s right.\n\nForget what I said before about doing this for my pack! It’s terrible here, besides Mark and Tristan of course, but surely, they don’t have a big part in all this.\n\nI have never been happy living at home with my parents. They are always so mean to me, and they make me feel like I can’t do anything right, but at this moment, more than anything in the world–I just want to leave here, even if it means I have to go back to them.\n\nI’d even go back to the sewage treatment center if I had to.\n\nI close the curtain and spy the gown on the table. With a deep breath, I reach around and unzip my dress.\n\nThe torment is just beginning.",

        "content": "Rose\n\nI am naked, on a bed, and my legs are spread wide open. This is how I wait for the doctor. How attractive….\n\nThe lovely nurse from before has just left. She came into the examination room to check on me, saying that she wasn’t sure I could manage by myself since, clearly, I have rocks for brains, and when she arrived, she said that the doctor would be in in a moment, so I may as well go ahead and put my feet in the stirrups.\n\nThat was at least five minutes ago.\n\nThankfully, I have a sheet draped over my legs, and the gown I have on covers the top of me.\n\nI stare up at a bright light, wondering if this might burn my corneas if I have to stay here much longer. That would be a great excuse to use to get sent away. Maybe then, I’ll have the opportunity to run away and strike out on my own.\n\nI am imagining the doctor will be an eighty-year-old man with cold hands and the same attitude that the nurse had. That would be my luck.\n\nWhy is it that no one who works at the castle is nice?\n\nTristan and Mark are nice…. Mark was quiet, but not in a rude way. And Tristan was overly friendly. I like them both, but they aren’t workers here, it seems. Perhaps in another life, we could be friends–or something.\n\nI can’t help the physical reaction that happens inside of me when I think about either one of them. I start to feel myself becoming damper and damper between my spread thighs, and a tiny ache begins low beneath my belly.\n\nRealizing I don’t want the doctor to catch me in such a state, I decide to think about something else–anything else. The last thing I need is for the doctor to realize something has me excited.\n\nI envision myself back at the sewage treatment facility and how embarrassing it was the day that I threw up.\n\nThere, that does the trick. No matter what happens, I must keep my mind off of those two guys I bumped into until this examination is over so the doctor won’t see the evidence of my true feelings.\n\nA few moments after I’ve steeled my resolve, I hear the curtain fly open. “Hello!” a friendly female voice says, and I look up to see a small woman, perhaps only about five feet tall, with dark hair pulled back in a bun and small spectacles balanced on the end of her nose. She is wearing a lab coat and carrying a clipboard.\n\n“Hi,” I manage to get out of my dry mouth. Talking is not my strong suit today.\n\n“Sorry to keep you waiting, dear. I’m Dr. Penderghan. How are you, honey?” She smiles down at me, standing near my head.\n\nI don’t know how to answer that, so I finally give her the truth. “Terrified.”\n\n“Oh, dear!” she says, patting my shoulder. “I’m so sorry. I know this isn’t easy. But I’ll try to have you out of here as quickly as possible, all right?”\n\nI am beginning to think I have gone into the wrong examination room because she is awfully nice, and so far, I haven’t had the sort of luck that brings me nice people. Well, other than the two muscle men.\n\n“Okay,” I say, hoping she’s telling the truth so I can leave.\n\n“Now, I just need to check a few things, dear, make sure you’re in good shape if the king decides to make you our lucky winner.” She smiles at me like I am here for some sort of a contest and not as a favor to my entire pack. But then… I suppose most of the other girls would think of themselves as winners if they are chosen.\n\nNot me. That would make me the biggest loser.\n\n“All right. First I’m going to do a physical exam, and then I’ll use the ultrasound machine. I’ll have Nurse Maria come in to observe so you can feel comfortable that everything is fine, all right dear?”\n\nI nod, but if Nurse Maria was the mean lady I’d met before, I don’t want her in here.\n\nDr. Penderghan sticks her head out of the curtain and calls for Nurse Maria. A moment later, another older woman walks in. It isn’t the same nurse as before, thank the Moon Goddess.\n\n“All right,” the doctor says, and I focus my eyes on the ceiling trying to put myself somewhere else as she goes about her physical examination.\n\nIt’s not as bad as I think it’s going to be. She basically just checks to see whether or not I am a virgin. Satisfied that I am, she moves on.\n\n“Now, this ultrasound machine will just give us a good look at your reproductive organs,” she says. “Sorry the gel is cold.”\n\nMy gown is pulled up, but the sheet is still over my bottom portion, and she’s told me I can take my feet out of the stirrups, thank goodness.\n\nShe’s right–the gel is cold. She rubs it all over my stomach with a wand, and then the machine comes to life, and her eyes are glued on that as she moves the wand around.\n\nAfter a few moments, Dr. Penderghan makes a sound like she’s trying to suck all of the oxygen out of the room.\n\nAlarmed, I turn my eyes to the screen. I hadn’t been watching before because I have no idea what I should be looking at. I still don’t.\n\n“Nurse Maria, do you see what I see?” Dr. Penderghan says, her voice a sharp whisper.\n\nNurse Maria comes over next to me and stares at the little screen. She inhales loudly too.\n\n“That’s… amazing!” she says.\n\n“I know!” Dr. Penderghan agrees. “One in a million!”\n\nI swallow hard. I have no idea what they’re talking about, but it sounds like they are happy about it. All I can think about is that whatever is on that screen is probably not helping me earn my ticket out of this awful place.\n\nDr. Penderghan puts the wand down, clicks off the machine, pulls out a few photographs she’s apparently printed, and turns to me as Nurse Maria wipes the gel off of my skin. “Have you ever had an exam like this before, dear?”\n\nI shake my head. No words are coming out of my mouth.\n\n“Well, you have a very unusual anatomical trait that most women do not have. You have two uterine horns, dear. Like a wolf. Most shifters only have one uterus, like a human.”\n\n“Ookay,” I mutter. “So… what does that mean?”\n\n“It means your chances of conceiving are very, very good,” she says with a wide smile.\n\nI can only stare at her.\n\nSelfishly, this is terrible news for me.\n\nThere’s a bustle around me as they discuss what to do. I am in a trance, wondering exactly what this means for me.\n\n“Get dressed, dear,” Dr. Penderghan tells me, and then they both leave. And I am alone.\n\nWith my two uterine horns….\n\nI pull myself up off of the table and get dressed, sitting back down to hook my shoes. A few moments later, Dr. Penderghan calls, “Are you dressed, dear?”\n\n“Yes,” I tell her, and she pulls the curtain open.\n\n“The king would like to see you immediately, honey. I will walk with you.”\n\nMy head rocks back and forth, and I press my feet to start moving like I’m some sort of automaton or zombie.\n\nDr. Penderghan is overjoyed as she walks down the hallway with me. She is practically humming with excitement. I don’t know what to think about any of this. Perhaps King Gene will think I am some sort of an abomination from how I’m walking and send me straight home.\n\nWe do not enter the king’s office as I expected. Instead, we head towards a large auditorium, and Dr. Penderghan walks me up on stage.\n\nBright lights shine into my eyes, but as I look out at the crowd, I can tell that there are dozens, maybe hundreds of people out there. I can’t see many faces, but I can see the front row. I recognize the red-headed girl I spoke to before and that blonde who was so stuck up.\n\nWhy are all of these people here?\n\nWhy am I here?\n\n“This is her?” King Gene says to the doctor as we walk over to him. He looks shocked to see me again so soon.\n\n“Yes, Your Majesty,” she says and hands him the pictures.\n\nHe looks at them and makes the same annoying ‘ahh’ sound like the doctor and nurse had done. “Very well,” he says. “Thank you, Doctor.”\n\nDr. Penderghan nods her head, and then steps back beside me as King Gene quiets the crowd.\n\n“Ladies, gentlemen, and all citizens of the kingdom,” he begins as the crowd quiets to a hum, and I find myself looking out at the audience as well. “It is with great pleasure that I announce to you that our Breeder has been found!”\n\nI look around. Is there another woman on the stage? Who is she?\n\nThen… he answers the question for me. “Rose Forrest of Elm pack!” He is gesturing at me!\n\nI’m the Breeder? Because of my stupid abnormal uterus? That’s all it takes? Really?!\n\nI don’t even know how to react. My knees are threatening to give way. All I want to do is to run down off of the stage and hide somewhere–anywhere.\n\nBut I’m here, and I can’t. There are guards for one thing. Also, my parents would murder me if I came home now. News travels fast here and when they found out I had been selected and had managed to outrun the king’s guard, they wouldn’t accept me back in their house. They would beat me out in the streets like a stray dog caught stealing food.\n\nI try to refocus my attention on the room around me. Many people in the crowd are clapping and cheering, but on some of the other girls’ faces, I see outrage.\n\n“What?” I hear a voice shriek, and I look out to see it is the blonde from before. “No fucking way!” she screams.\n\n“Calm down, Kerry,” a brunette next to her says, looking around to see if the guards are moving in on Kerry. The brunette has to rub Kerry’s back to stop the girl’s hyperventilating.\n\nI know who she is now. Kerry Hill. From Brush pack. Her father, Alpha Robert, is one of the most powerful Alphas in the kingdom.\n\nIt’s no wonder she’s mad. She probably feels she deserves to be the one to carry the future heir and maybe even marry the next king.\n\nThey won’t expect me to do that, will they?\n\nI can’t even think about what all of this means!\n\nKerry is escorted from the auditorium, along with a few other angry girls who are interrupting the king. I wonder if they will be punished for getting out of line, but I doubt it. They should be given some leniency for coming all this way and not getting what they’d hoped for. Like some sort of participation award that says, ‘Breeder Tournament: Runner-Up.’\n\nNow that’s something tangible I can brag about. Not two uterine horns….\n\n“Thank you all for coming,” King Gene continues. “Now… you may all go!”\n\nFor a moment, I hope that I am somehow included in that statement.\n\nBut it doesn't last. He turns to me and says, “Except for you, of course.” A wicked smile pulls back his parted lips, and panic washes over me.\n\nWhat have I gotten myself into?",

Still, my heart is pounding in my chest. I wonder what in the world is going to happen to me now.\n\n“Well, I must say,” the Alpha King begins as soon as we are mostly alone, “when I met you earlier, I was not expecting you to be the winner.”\n\nI can only stare at him. Believe me, I wasn’t either!\n\n“But once Dr. Penderghan told me of your unique situation, well, how could I choose anyone else?” He smiles at me again, and like before, I feel my stomach tighten. I don’t like that smile.\n\nIt’s… creepy and makes me question his sincerity.\n\n“I think that she’s a bit overwhelmed,” Dr. Penderghan says, resting her hand on my shoulder.\n\n“Perhaps we should let her have a rest before you introduce her to the Alphas?”\n\nKing Gene is still staring at me, and I’ve felt his eyes wandering along my form as the doctor is speaking. When that handsome man in the hallway did that earlier, it made me feel attractive and beautiful. But this makes me feel almost as creepy as his smile.\n\n“Yes, yes, of course,” the king finally says. “Beta Sam! Can you and Shelby escort Miss Rose to her room?”\n\n“Yes, Alpha,” the man who is still standing at the edge of the stage answers. I look at him closely for the first time and see he isn’t much older than me. I had no idea that the Beta was so young.\n\nPerhaps he hasn’t been the Beta for long? No one ever speaks of the Alpha King’s Beta.\n\nHe gestures for me to meet him at the stairwell, and I realize, with the king in the room, I’ll have to back down the stairs.\n\nIn these shoes, that seems dangerous.\n\nI’m not supposed to turn my back on the king, though.\n\nThankfully, before I make it to the edge of the stairs, the king turns and walks off in the other direction.\n\nThank the Moon Goddess!\n\nBeta Adam offers me his hand, and I take it. He helps guide me down the stairs as I hold up my gown with the other hand.\n\n“Hello, Miss Rose,” he says to me in a kind voice. He is quite good-looking himself, though not as handsome as the men I met in the hallway. He’s tall and strong with reddish-blond hair and kind green eyes. My body doesn’t feel a spark when I’m around him, but I’m happy to at least have another friendly face to add to my circle seeing as I might be stuck here for a while.\n\n“Hello,” I say to him, realizing I’m shaking a bit. I’m so nervous about all of this. I can hardly even wrap my mind around what’s happening.\n\nAm I really going to be the Breeder for four men??\n\n“This is my wife, Shelby,” he says and the woman who was standing near him earlier walks over. She’s adorable, with a button nose and apple cheeks. Her hair is a bit more brunette than his but still with shades of red. She has a smattering of freckles across her nose. I think she is probably just a few years older than me.\n\n“Hello,” I greet her. “It’s nice to meet you.”\n\n“You, too,” she says with a smile, and instead of shaking my hand, she loosely wraps her arms around me, like we are already long-time friends. “I’m so excited to get to know you!”\n\nDr. Penderghan pats my back and says, “I shall see you soon, dear,” before she heads off to the exit.\n\nI hear Adam mutter to Shelby, “Calm down, honey. Don’t overwhelm her.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” Shelby apologizes. “It’s just… there aren’t a lot of women here around our age. Except for the maids, and the king prefers that we don’t fraternize with them if we can help it.”\n\n“I understand,” I sympathize, forcing a smile. It isn’t that I don’t appreciate the fact that she wants to be my friend. I don’t have a lot of friends, none that I’m even going to miss, so it would be great to have a friend here. But I am so nervous, I can’t even think, let alone try to be happy.\n\n“Shall we?” Beta Adam says, and I nod, following him.\n\nShelby walks beside me, and as we go, she asks me questions about my family and my life back home. I can only give her short answers. Words seem to stick in my throat. It might be a condition I need to ask Dr. Penderghan about later, but I self-diagnose it as my mind still trying to compute that this is my home now–for the moment anyway.\n\nWe walk down long winding hallways that seem to all look the same, and I wonder how in the world I’ll ever figure out how to make my way around here on a daily basis.\n\n“Don’t worry, you’ll figure out the hallways,” Shelby assures, as if reading my mind.\n\n“I hope so,” I say, but I’m not sure, and a bit frightened that she knew my thoughts so easily.\n\nWe turn down another hallway, and Beta Adam pulls up.\n\nThere’s a man there, coming toward us from down the narrow hall, walking rather quickly. He has dark hair and a muscular build–that seems to be a theme around here–much like the other two men I ran into earlier. His chiseled jaw is set, and he looks annoyed. His dark eyes are glued to the floor, and he only looks up in time to step around us.\n\n“Beg your pardon, Sam,” he says.\n\n“No problem, sir,” the Beta replies, and then I find the attractive man staring at me.\n\nHe scans me up and down for a second as we stop in the hallway, the four of us just standing there.\n\nFinally, he greets, “Hi,” and I manage to feign a smile at him, but I don’t know what to say.\n\n“Congratulations. You must be excited.”\n\n“Uh… yeah,” I choke out. I guess he knows who I am then. I have no idea who he is, but judging by his suit and his overall appearance, I’m guessing he is important.\n\n“Thousands of girls wanted the job you just won,” he continues, his tone becoming friendly the more he talks. Maybe he wasn’t in such a hurry after all.\n\nI am not sure what to say to that, so I just stand there… like an idiot.\n\nHe chuckles at me. “Well, I hope that you can get over your nervousness soon. You have no reason to be scared.” He pats me on the arm, and the touch of his hand sends electrical impulses all up and down my skin.\n\n“Th-thanks,” I stutter.\n\n“See you later.”\n\nI’m not sure if he’s talking to me or Adam or all three of us, so I say nothing, but when he withdraws his hand to carry along on his way, my arm feels cold, like it’s meant to have his hand on it.\n\nShelby giggles. “Isn’t he dreamy?”\n\nBefore I can respond, Beta Adam clears his throat. “You know I can hear you, right?”\n\n“Oh, Sam!” she says rushing up to grab his hand. “You know I think you’re the dreamiest of all!”\n\nPoor Beta Sam. He looks over to me for backup but I don’t want to lie. I remain silent.\n\nBy the time Shelby returns her attention to me, I feel it’s too late for me to speak. So I say nothing.\n\nBut yes… I do think that man was dreamy.\n\nWhoever he was.\n\nA few minutes later, we arrive at a large wooden double door, carved with flowers and filled with gold inlay.\n\nIt’s beautiful.\n\n“Here we are,” Beta Adam announces, pushing the door open.\n\nI stand outside and stare for a moment, first at the door… and then at the room.\n\nIt’s gorgeous–and huge. I think most of my house back home would fit in here.\n\nThere’s a living room area with a large plush red sofa set before an expansive television set.\n\nThe sitting area is nice and inviting, despite the bold colors. The rug on the rich wooden floor is also red with gold accents. My eyes follow it over to the bedroom area where a huge four-poster bed with a red canopy and matching silky red bedspread invites me to collapse and take a nap.\n\nAll of the woods are a rich brown color with red tints.\n\nBehind Beta Sam, there are three huge floor-to-ceiling windows with matching red and gold drapes. I can’t see outside just yet because of the angle, other than the bright azure sky. I can’t wait to rush over and see if there’s a garden view. That would be lovely.\n\n“This is great, isn’t it?” Shelby asks. “The king had it done up as a second Luna suite. Oh, and in there is your bathroom! All white marble with a jetted tub big enough for at least two! Who will be the lucky man?” Shelby giggles coquettishly.\n\nMy eyebrows arch. I would love to sit in it...alone if possible.\n\nI notice that the room matches my dress and wonder if that’s just a coincidence. It would have to be, I suppose.\n\n“It’s beautiful,” I tell them.\n\nShe walks over to an armoire and pulls it open. “There’s a ton of clothes in here. I think you will find that everything is in your size, but if not, let us know, and we’ll get you the right fit.”\n\nAll I can say is, “Thank you.” It probably makes me seem unappreciative given the room that was just offered to me, but, you know, I didn’t ask for any of this.\n\nShe smiles at me and closes the armoire door.\n\n“Well… I’m sure you’re probably tired,” Beta Adam says. “We’ll get your luggage from your escort and make sure that you have your things from home.”\n\nI haven’t brought much, but I would like to have the little I did pack. “Thank you.” That seems to be all I can say.\n\n“Of course. You’ll have some servants, but we’ll give you a chance to rest before we bring them in to meet you. If you do require anything, just pick up the phone and dial nine.” He gestures to the gold antique-style telephone on the nightstand.\n\n“Thank you…”\n\nHe smiles at me and then gestures for Shelby. “Come on, honey.”\n\nShe walks back over to me first. Wrapping me up in another hug, she squeezes tighter this time.\n\n“I’m so glad you’re here,” she says before the two of them give me a little wave and leave the room.\n\nI am alone–and I feel it. Even though Shelby is nice, and I’ve met some very attractive men who seem to be interested in me, it doesn’t matter because I have no idea who they are. And I still haven’t met the four men I’m meant to bed.\n\nMy eyes go to that piece of furniture. All I want to do is fall asleep and wake up back at home.\n\nI sit down on the edge and take off my shoes, but I’m too afraid to change clothes since I have no idea when I might be summoned. I lay down on top of the blanket that matches my dress and close my eyes, wondering what will happen next.",

The hickey marks on my neck appear to be brighter as well.\n\nI wince and move my head back as Vienna brings a brush with concealer close to the marks. I don’t want the marks covered. I want to broadcast them to the world. She looks down at me and smiles.\n\n“I don’t think there is a need for that,” I say. I really am proud of my hickey marks. I can hear a faint groan coming from Vienna. It appears she doesn’t quite agree with my decision.\n\n“I think it is best if we cover them. The lunch buffet we have planned is going to host lots of people. It is bad eno",

I know I look like a hot mess, and I can feel some watery mucus dripping from my nose. I grimace as I can imagine what he is thinking seeing me in such a state. Why am I worried about what I look like in the supposed comfort and privacy of my room?\n\nWhat is he doing in my bedroom? Didn’t his mother teach him that girls’ rooms are a no-no for boys? Do I need a privacy signpost on my door now?\n\nMy frustration with Emily and the blabbering Mark is turning into rage, and I am afraid if I don’t get a grip on my emotions, I will take them out on Tristan. He is innocent… wait, scratch that. He is busy snooping in my room and thus is not innocent either.\n\n“What are you doing in here, Alpha Tristan?” I try to be as polite as I can muster given the present circumstances and my somber mood.\n\n“The door was unlocked..

Earlier, when she was getting me ready, she’d said, “Alpha Tristan sent a message earlier, while you were napping, that he’d be here around seven. He said for his ‘little flower’ to be ready for him.\n\nLittle flower… that is his nickname for me. I like it.

        "content": "*This story does NOT contain incest. All male love interests are NOT blood-related to the female protagonist*\n\n“Ah Ah Ahh! ... Edward please stop…we…ah…cannot do this…ahh,” I panted between kisses as my step uncle’s tongue invaded my mouth, twirling against my own tongue as he gently sucked them with passion.\n\n“Didn’t I tell you to call me ‘Professor’ while we are at work?” he replied mockingly before continuing to defile my mouth. My body froze from shock at what was happening as my hands clenched tightly against his white lab coat. I tried to break my lips away from his kiss only for his warm and large hands to push the back of my head directing my wet lips back towards his hungry lips and seeking tongue once again.\n\n“I’ll give you so much pleasure that you’ll forget all about Lucien…” he chuckled in my ear and whispered to me in his deep and seductive voice.\n\n“ah … please,” another set of moans unintentionally escaped my lips to my own surprise. I was losing control of my mind and body as his big manly hands slowly slid inside my lab coat and cupped my left breast, massaging them intensely. The sensation sent a jolt through me and I started to feel a sudden rush of warmth and stickiness easing out from between my legs. No, I am reacting to him so fast and so strongly. As if he could sense my arousal, his lean body cornered me driving my back against his work table then wedged his left leg in between my thighs. I tried to plead with him to stop but the only sounds that I could produce were sensual moans mixed with my hard breathing. My uncle was now fondling both of my breasts over my clothes.\n\n“No … stop … I can’t …” I moaned and gasped as his tongue slowly licked my ear lobes and then sucked my ear making wet sucking sounds. The sensation was so intense that I opened my eyes wide just to see his handsome face and his eyes burning with desire for me gazing back at me. So similar, I thought in the heat of that moment, his green eyes, dark brown hair, his beautiful straight nose, his playful lips, and his lean and slightly muscular body are so similar to the man I love and have secretly yearned for…my stepfather.\n\nHe kissed me again deeply, thrusting his tongue deep into my mouth. Our mixed saliva dripping out of my lips every time he changed the angle of our kiss. Moaning between our kisses, I could feel his thigh pressed upwards against my throbbing secret passage.\n\n“You’re grinding your pussy against my leg,” Edward teased.\n\nMy whole body froze at his words. I immediately felt embarrassed realizing how much control I have lost to this man. During my shock, his hands quickly tore open the front of my blouse and pushed my bra out of the way to reveal my naked breasts. I felt the cold temperature of the lab on my bare skin and my nipples hardened instantly. The cold was momentary as he quickly covered my left breast with his warm hand and my right nipple with his hot mouth.\n\n“No … please!” I cried out in a voice so strained I hardly recognized as my own as I felt his hot tongue lapping fast at my hard nipple as my other breast was squeezed and rubbed hard repeatedly. My hands were in his hair as he continued to suck harder on my hard and swollen nipple. The harder he sucked, the louder I moaned and felt my pussy pulsate and clenched down there. I was losing control to the pleasure and started to grind my pussy harder and faster against his thigh for temporary relief.\n\n“You’re dripping wet down here … I guess your dirty uncle turned you on so much huh?” he whispered cunningly in my ear as his pushed his fingers against the center of my crotch rubbing it through the lace of my underwear.\n\n“You’ve completed soaked through your underwear. Did you cum just from me sucking your breasts?”\n\nSuddenly, my skirt was hiked upwards to hang loosely around my waist and I felt the cold air against my wet and hot area that was now fully exposed. He pulled my underwear all the way down my legs and off in one swift motion. Without the fabric to restrain the wetness inside of me, I felt my love juices slowly spilling out of my private lips onto my thighs, making me realize how wet I have been all this time.\n\n“No more…someone might come in…” I whispered the only excuse I could think of to get him to stop.\n\n“Then I guess you better keep those lewd noises you’ve been making down huh?” he replied and thrusted his middle finger into my love hole in one deep and fast motion. I cried out in pleasure, my legs barely able to support my weight and I leaned back against the table for support. Wet sounds filled my uncle’s entire office as he moved his finger in and out of me before curling up inside me to explore the upper of my cave searching for my most pleasurable spot inside.\n\n“Is this where you like it?” he asked in an alluringly husky voice as his finger pressed against my spot. I could feel myself becoming wetter and wetter as he continued to stimulate that spot. I couldn’t take the pleasure building inside my pussy and started grinding hard against his hand as I moaned loudly in abandon. Smacking wet sounds echoed throughout the room mixing with our panting and passionate moans. Sensing that I wanted more, he pushed in another finger inside of me and started thrusting even harder and faster from various different angles.\n\n“Your pussy is sucking in my fingers … you are such a slut. I can’t wait to fuck you hard,” he groaned into my ears while fingering me hard and then proceeded to suck on my erect nipples.\n\n-To be continued...",

        "content": "His other hand pinched my swollen-hard clitoral nub making the sweet ache between my legs unbearable for me and I could feel it approaching…my orgasm.\n\nMy arms wrapped around his neck pushing his head in for a wildly deep kiss involving our hot tongue and I cried my climax into his mouth as my release hit me hard. I arched my back against his body and fingers that were still deeply buried in my hole and wrapped my legs tight around his hips drawing his whole body closer to me. The last sensation I remembered before my mind went completely blank was the rush of hot liquid released from the inner depths of my pussy.\n\n“Wake up Natalia…we’re not finished yet.”\n\nI wasn’t sure if it was his voice or the sensation of my entrance being suddenly stretched that brought me back to my senses. He had lifted me to sit on his work table and I felt it…Big, Hot and Hard as it pumped into my cave. His cock was plunging into my hole as his hands held my legs wide open to grant him access to my inner core.\n\n“You’re still so tight down here even after cumming that hard … guess my fingers were not enough for your hungry pussy…”\n\nHe reared back to remove his shaft from me before slamming it all the way inside my quivering pussy. It was both painful and pleasurable at the same time as my pussy walls adjusted to the size and shape of him.\n\n“Don’t clench around me too tightly, I’m about to move…hold your legs open wider for me,” Edward commanded.\n\nAs if bounded by the magic of his command, I held my legs wide open for him as he thrusted fast and hard in and out of my sopping wet cunt. Thrust, thrust, thrust…pumping harder and deeper each time. His big dick was rubbing my inner walls and hitting my womb deep inside with each thrust. Just as his cock was thrusting deep inside me, his tongue was thrusting deep inside my mouth to contain my screams of pleasures as I whimpered passionately into his mouth.\n\nOh father, please forgive me for this. His face and build which are so similar to my father is turning me on so much. My uncle hoisted me into a sitting position to thrust into me even more deeply and soon he was groaning madly and pumping wildly into me non-stop. I felt like my whole body has melted to mush in his arms and with each stroke of his dick inside of me, I inched closer to my climax.\n\n“I’m … gonna ... gonna …” I panted and wrapped my legs around his hips pushing my pussy up even closer to the base of his cock.\n\n“Cum…let’s cum together Natalia!” He panted hard in my ear and scooped my body into his arms lifting my ass off the table and pushing my ass to grind harder and faster against his hips as he wildly pumped his cock inside my pleasure hole. I clenched my legs around his hips and my pussy around his cock one final time before screaming out wildly as my climax hit me again. He screwed his dick into me one last time, his dick twitched and his balls contracted shooting his hot seed deep into my cunt.\n\n**ring ring ring**\n\n“Hi, Lucien. Yup, we’re wrapping up at work now. I will drop your daughter off in a few minutes…No, I don’t think I can stay over for dinner. Alright, see you soon.\n\n“As you heard, your father wants you back now. You better get dressed so I can drive you back home. I wouldn’t want to keep my dear brother waiting to have dinner with his beloved daughter for too long, now can I? ... come down to the car when you’re done.”\n\nI was still exhausted from our steamy session as I felt his cock gliding out of me followed by the mix of our love juices spilling out of my opening onto my legs and the floor. That was when I realized that this was the first time in my life that I did it raw and had a man’s seed buried deep inside me. The smell of our sex hung heavily in the room along with the silence as my uncle dressed and left without saying another word.\n\nI dressed up as fast as I could in my state of confusion and grabbed my bag before heading out of his office down towards the parking lot where he was waiting. What have I done? How did I lose all of my control and give myself over like that to my uncle? What I did was so wrong, immoral, and disgusting…thinking of and desiring my father as I let my uncle fuck me senseless in his office…but wait … how did he know? Cold sweat ran down my spine as I realized that he somehow knew my dark secret. He knew of my love and yearning for my stepfather. Edward, he knows about my forbidden love towards his older brother…\n\nI picked up my mobile and saw a message from my step cousin, Zak. My heart started beating faster in my chest as I wondered what it was that he wanted from me.\n\n“How was the first week of your internship with uncle Edward?  I miss having you in my arms. Let me know if you are free later tonight…Love you always.”\n\nTo be continued…",

        "content": "Our life together as a new family was amazing and just like a fairytale dream come true. We lived in a big mansion after we moved in to live with Lucien and his family at their family estate. We spent so much time as a family going out on vacations whenever Lucien was free from work at his family’s company. Everything was perfect. Too perfect…that it did not last.\n\n“Your mother is at the hospital, Natalia. I’ve sent the driver to pick you up. Please come as soon as possible,” Lucien said. Lucien, why is your voice shaking?\n\nLess than a year into their marriage. My mother passed away suddenly due to a road accident. Just like that, my only blood relative was gone. Her small funeral was held quietly with only her close friends and Lucien’s family in attendance. As I stood in a black dress beside Lucien to greet the guests, I felt so numb from the pain that I wished that the wind would just blow me away.\n\n“What will happen to the child? They were only married for around 10 months? Does she have other family members on her mother’s side that can take her in?” they were whispering so loud and acting as if I’m no longer here. Mother is gone…what will become of me now? Where will I go? How will I live? I miss my Mother… Tears that I had been holding back streamed down my face slowly as I began to sob softly.\n\nThen I felt a warm arm around my shoulders and in the next instant Lucien’s face was looking directly at me. Lucien has bent down to hug me tight to his chest. “We will be ok. I am here for you. Let’s continue to live together because we are a family. I love you, Natalia,” Lucien whispered and kissed my forehead softly. Those words and that kiss, saved me and my life.\n\n--- Ten Years Later ---\n\nI am now 22, and in my final year of university. The past ten years flew by and I have grown from a child to a young woman with a bright future ahead of me. I’ve continued living with my stepfather, Lucien, after my mother passed away. Lucien has been loving and supportive of me and the best father I could ever imagine for these past ten years. I am thankful to have him as my father and family but starting from my high school years, I started to yearn for more…\n\n“Natalia. Please be home for dinner on time today. I have something to discuss with you,” Lucien called to tell me. He seems unusually excited. Perhaps he wants to discuss about my internship at the company’s laboratory.\n\n“Sure. I’ll be back on time. See you then!” I replied to him in a cheerful voice. After all, I really do like to spend time with him and everything he does feels special to me. I hang up with a small smile on my lips as I look forward to having dinner with him, hearing his stories, laughing with him while watching him smile. All of those moments make my heart beat faster.\n\n…\n\n“Lucien, I'm home!” I excitedly announce as I walk in the door. Two maids immediately walked in to assist me with my bag and coat. After entering high school, I came to dislike calling my stepfather as ‘father’ so we have been calling each other by our names and that makes me feel so happy. I walked towards the dining room where I believe Lucien must be waiting for me.\n\n“Hi there! I’m Angela! Nice to finally meet you, Natalia.”\n\nA blond woman with sparkling blue eyes, gigantic tits and a curvy ass in a tight dress stood up from the table to greet me with an overly friendly hug.\n\n“Hi. I’m Natalia, nice to meet you too,” I replied politely plastering on my face one of my most sweet smile that I have been trained to present during social gathering occasions. My eyes darted around to try to locate Lucien. He was nowhere in sight. Where is he? ... and who is she?\n\nWe both sat down at the dinner table where three courses of meal have been prepared and laid out by our maids. Thankfully Lucien walked into the room as I was fishing into my head to find some topic to start a conversation to fill in this awkward silence.\n\n“Natalia, You’re back. Welcome home sweetie. Let me introduce you to our beautiful guest of the evening! This is Angela…she is my fiancé. Angela, this is Natalia, my daughter,” Lucien turned to me with the most ecstatic smile on his face. It took all the energy and soul in my body to plaster a sweet and joyful smile onto my face. If the world is going to come to an end, may it be now.\n\nThe three of us shared polite and seemingly pleasant conversations about random things as we ate our dinner. I had my body turned on autopilot with my training to act as a lady to deal with these events while my real-self retreated inside my mind as a way to handle the shock. Lucien looked straight at me multiple times over the course of dinner, showing me that he probably knew that I was not taking this as well as he would have hoped. I made random comments here and there as appropriate throughout dinner.\n\n--To be continued...",

        "content": "“Natalia, you are looking for an internship for your last semester of university, right? I would love it if you would consider working for our family’s company after you graduate. Of course, I’m not going to force you but I think it would be a good opportunity for you to learn more about our business during your internship. I spoke to your uncle, Edward, and he thinks you can learn a lot from him by working with him in managing one of our company’s laboratory,” Lucien cheerfully suggested to me with a beaming smile. I didn’t care what he said, I would do anything he asks with that smile.\n\n“Oh sure. I guess it is time that I learn about our business as well…” I replied with a small smile of my own.\n\n“Great then. Edward will be coming over later tonight after he gets off work to discuss some potential roles for you. Feel free to ask him anything.”\n\nWith that the dinner came to an end and I rapidly excused myself to go back to my room. I walked upstairs to my room and immediately told my maid that I wanted to spend some time alone. When alone in my room, the emotions that I had bottled up overwhelmed me. I felt tears sting my eyes and rolled down my cheeks slowly as reality sank in that Lucien will soon be marrying another woman. Sure, he has had girlfriends in the past but I did my best to ignore them knowing that none of them would last. I never dreamt that a day would come that I would have to share Lucien with another woman.\n\n**knock knock**\n\n“Natalia, it’s me.” Great, Lucien is here and I am crying my eyes out.\n\n“Please come in…”\n\nLucien opened the door and immediately strode in to sit beside me on my bed.\n\n“Congratulations on your engagement, Lucien,” I faked a smile and tried to keep my voice from cracking. I need to hold back my tears!\n\n“Thank you … but … if you are really happy for me … why does it look like you’ve been crying?”\n\nI’m not surprised. Lucien knows me very well after all.\n\n“Listen to me, Natalia. It’s been ten years now that your mother has left us. Soon you will become an adult and have your own independent life. I love you and wish you the best. I believe having Angela will help complete our family and she can help me support you…”\n\n“Yes, I understand. Please don’t worry about me…” I replied and plastered a sweet smile on my face and hugged him tightly in order to hide the pained look on my face and the tears that threaten to fall.\n\n“I want to take a little nap before seeing uncle Edward…please enjoy your evening!”\n\n“Ok…Remember, I love you,” Lucien whispered in my ear and kissed my forehead lovingly just like he has always done all those years when I was a kid. Now the parts of me that he has touched and kissed burn with a new throbbing heat. Lucien left the room and I collapse onto my bed.\n\nI am so sleepy and my head hurts from all the crying that I’ve done. I need to rest so that my eyes are not puffy when I meet uncle Edward. I slowly head down the stairs feeling my way aiming to fetch some ice packs in the kitchen to place on my swollen eyes.\n\n“Ah….Ah….Lucien…please...”\n\nI can hear a woman’s voice coming from Lucien’s study. Without thinking I inch closer to the source of that sound. The study door was left slightly ajar. No, I can’t do this…I should not see this…but…\n\nI could not stop myself and peered into the room.\n\nThrust. Thurst. Thurst.\n\nA disheveled Angela with her back towards me was straddling Lucien while bouncing her hips up and down his shaft. Her arms wrapped around Lucien’s neck as she kissed him passionately, moaning her desire. Her short tight dress was hiked up around her waist where Lucien held her as he pumped his hard dick inside her dripping wet pussy. Angela’s round shapely breasts bounced up and down to his rhythm as he rammed his sex tool into her love hole repeatedly.\n\n“I’m cumming….I love you….ah…Lucien…harder!” Angela screamed with abandon as she rode his cock faster nearing her climax. Lucien let her climax as he wove his hand through her blond hair. Angela is indeed beautiful and fun to have sex with, he thought, since his family has specifically chosen her to be his bride due to their desire to form a business partnership with her father’s company. He might as well take her and enjoy it while he can…after all, Natalia is becoming a young woman now and it won’t be long until she finds the right man for her.\n\nI watched as Lucien withdrew his member and flipped Angela onto her stomach on the sofa. Ah…this is the first time that I’m seeing his member and it’s erect. Oh god, it’s so big and so beautiful! I cannot peel my eyes away from that object of my desire. Suddenly, I felt a pleasurable sensation on the sensitive place between my legs and realized in shame that I have started touching myself while fantasizing about Lucien’s cock. Ah…Lucien, I want your cock deep inside my pussy…please…\n\n“Raise your hips…I want to take you from behind. Good girl…just like that,” Lucien commanded Angela in a low voice and she quickly complied to his wishes.\n\nLucien got behind her and positioned his swollen dick at her opening before ramming it into her all in a single thrust. His hands grabbed both her tits and squeezed them tight as he pumped into her from behind. Their moans and groans of ec****y filled the room.\n\nI stifled my moan as I plunged a finger into my tight and hot hole. Lucien, if only you were the one inside of me right now… At that moment, I think his eyes met mine...\n\nI turned and fled from the room as fast as I could back to my bedroom. That was my imagination right, there was no way he saw me watching them…right?\n\nLucien was quite certain he saw someone peeking at them from the door and prayed that it was not Natalia. Yeah right, it was definitely Natalia. He continued to fuck Angela with thoughts of his stepdaughter in mind, pumping into her faster and harder as he near his release. I wonder if her pussy is warm and tight…Natalia! He screamed her name in his mind as he shot loads of his cum inside Angela’s eagerly awaiting pussy. He asked his driver to send her home and called Edward, his 5-year younger brother.\n\n--To be continued…",

        "content": "“Natalia should be up in her room. I told her you were coming over to chat about her internship roles…Please help support her,” Lucien explained to his brother while patting him on the back.\n\n“Your girl has grown up into a fine young lady now huh? She’s about to graduate from university and start working already … I wonder if she has a boyfriend?” Edward teased Lucien with a chuckle in his voice.\n\nLucien knew that Edward was still single and even after fooling around with multiple women he dated on-and-off, he has still not settled down. Well, nothing wrong with that I guess, Lucien thought to himself.\n\n“You should go up to see Natalia before it gets later than it already is…see you at our next meeting when you come to headquarters,” Lucien nodded to his brother and went up to his room.\n\n…\n\nI had a shower to clear my head and washed my hair using my favorite shampoo. Lucien picked out this scent for me when we went shopping together a few years back and I’ve been using it ever since. Smelling this makes me think of him and makes me want him…\n\n“Ah…Lucien…Ah….Lu…Lucien…,” I moaned as I closed my eyes and imagined him embracing my body, touching my breasts, pinching my nipples, stroking my wet secret spot between my legs.\n\nI tossed my towel aside and laid naked on my bed squeezing my left nipple while my right hand drew circular patterns around my hard clitoris. I was already sopping wet down there and getting even hotter and wetter as I imagined my stepfather having his way with me. I’ve masturbated countless times while yearning for Lucien and each time I came harder and harder. I suspect this time would be even more intense because I have just witnessed Lucien satisfying his desires with another woman. I’ve seen in real life the face and sounds he makes when he is rutting with desire.\n\nI spread my legs wide apart and rammed my fingers into my tight pussy hole as I visualize his big, hot and slick dick giving me pleasure. I moaned out loud continuously as I pumped my fingers inside faster while my pussy made wet slurping noises. My pussy clenched hard around my fingers as I neared my climax. I couldn’t take it anymore and rolled onto my stomach and pumped my hips up and down as I rode my own fingers…\n\n“Lucien! Fuck me harder….Lucien…I’m gonna…I’m cumming! Lucien…Lu…Lucien!! Ah!!”\n\nLittle did I know at the time that this act for my temporary pleasure would end up exposing my dirty little secret…\n\n…\n\nAt that same moment, Edward was standing on the other side of Natalia’s bedroom door. Although it was not intentional, he overheard her lustful moans through the door followed clearly by his older brother’s name: Lucien. Oh Natalia, you have grown up to be so naughty…perhaps I should be the one to teach you…, Edward smirked while thinking to himself. After waiting for her orgasmic moans to quiet down, he knocked lightly on her door. “Natalia. This is Edward…I’m coming in…” Without waiting for her reply, he pushed opened the door.\n\nThe moment I heard Edward’s voice, I snapped out of my fantasy and quickly wrapped my towel around my naked body just in time as the door swung open and my uncle strode confidently inside. Edward is my father’s younger brother and heads all the laboratories owned by our family’s company. Although I admit that being able to lead the business at just the age of 33 is very impressive of him, I have never warmed towards him. His presence always intimidates me and he seems to have a talent of putting me in uncomfortable positions including now: I am naked with nothing but a towel wrapped around me and he is now sitting next to me on my bed. Apart from his outer appearance that is similar to Lucien that he could be his younger clone; there is nothing similar between these two brothers.\n\n“I’m happy you decided to intern with me at the lab. I’ll try my best to make the experience a pleasant learning experience for you, Natalia,” Edward said with a sweet smile on his lips as he patted my bare shoulder. He then went on to describe my role at the lab which included helping him supervise some research projects and acting as his personal secretary. As time went by, I became increasingly conscious of my lack of clothing and his closeness…\n\n“Well, that’s it. It’s getting late…I should head back now. You can always call me if you have any questions. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you well since your father has entrusted you to me,” he whispered one last time in my ears then stood up from the bed. I thanked him with the best smile that I could muster and he was out the door. Phew! I somehow survived that one. Working with Edward will be an eye-opening learning experience for me…right?\n\n---Back to the present day---\n\nBarely one week after I started my internship with Edward, we did that…in his office! My thoughts are now back to the present as I concentrate on maintaining my balance while making my way to Edward’s car so that he can drive me home. With every step I could feel an aching pain between my legs and the wetness of the seed he planted seeping out to wet my panties and slide down my inner thighs. No…I need to quickly get back and clean myself up.\n\nFinally, the moment I dreaded has arrived. I am now standing in front of Edward’s luxurious Bentley car door. I can do this…no one must find out about what happened today…especially not Lucien. I sucked in a deep breath, opened the car door and sat down on the red leather passenger seat next to my uncle.\n\nThe moment I sat down and closed the door, Edward leaned over to steal my lips. He slowly eased his tongue into my mouth as if to claim me as his hand squeezed my right breast firmly. I turned my head away to escape his kiss and tried to remove his hand from my breast.\n\n“Stop! Please…no more!” I protested loudly.\n\n“Your body is so sensitive, should we go for another round in my car, my dear niece?” Edward whispered in a seductive tone into my ear making my body shiver then he slipped his hand under my skirt pulling the crotch of my underwear aside to directly caress my wet entry. My body bucked under his hand as my pussy was still sensitive from our earlier affair and a short moan escaped my lips.\n\n“Don’t touch me!...mmhhh ahh.” My protest was halted by his wet fingers entering my mouth giving me a taste of our mixed love juices. It tasted wildly sweet and smelt very strong of our sex. He removed his fingers while chuckling to himself and brought his fingers to his own lips.\n\n“Our bodies are very compatible. Don’t you think, Natalia? I wonder what kind of face Lucien will make if he knows I made you cum so hard twice today?...or that you want to fuck him so much you even yelled out his name while masturbating?” he asked looking deep into my eyes with his face mere inches from my own. I felt like a slightly younger Lucien was asking me that question himself…\n\n“How did you know? No…Please, you can’t tell him,” I pleaded as tears stung my eyes. Anything but that! I love Lucien and even if we are not meant to be, I don’t want him to view me as a disgusting slut. I don’t want him to find out about my perverted lust towards him or that his little brother fucked me…\n\n“Walls have eyes and doors have ears, Natalia…I won’t say anything as long as you continue to entertain me. Although I wished we could go for another round right now, I think your father is expecting you,” Edward said while faking a huge sigh of regret as he started to drive me home.\n\n…\n\nI’m back home. Finally. The ride with Edward was fortunately uneventful. Upon entering the house, my maids were there to greet me and inform me that father was waiting in the dining room. “Please let him know that I will be down shortly…after I have changed,” I instructed the maids and quickly headed straight for my bedroom.\n\nThe hot water of the shower on my skin felt so good. I scrubbed my body at an attempt to get rid of that man’s touch and smell on my skin. I spread my legs a bit and position the shower head between my legs. I moaned a bit as the warm water hit my still-swollen clit. I stroked my pussy opening with my fingers to clean away Edward’s sticky cum and felt a slight discomforting pain remind me of his big potent member. He shot so much of his load inside me…should I take the pill?\n\nI pushed thoughts of Edward from my mind as I felt my eyes starting to sting with tears and hurriedly got dress to have dinner with my father. Lucien gave me a warm smile as I sat down opposite him. His smile warms my heart and I gaze into his beautiful green eyes.\n\n“Finally, it’s Friday. How was your first week with Edward? Did you find his work interesting?”\n\n“…Yes. I am still unsure if I like to work at the laboratories but…so far things are going…well.” I couldn’t go on. I didn’t want to talk about Edward. Full stop.\n\n“Has Edward been treating you well? He can be a little…assertive sometimes, but you can rest assured he is the best in his field. I’m sure you can learn many valuable lessons by staying by his side,” Lucien went on to further compliment his brother while continuing to eat. “Are you feeling sick? You look quite tired today…maybe you should go to bed early today?” Lucien had walked over to my side and placed his hand against my forehead while peering at my face with concern.\n\n“I’m fine…you don’t need to be worried,” I replied in a meek voice as I was lost in the depths of Lucien’s emerald-green eyes.\n\n“I see. Before I forget, I wanted to let you know that we’ll be going on a cruise trip with Angela next weekend. I think it would be nice for you girls to bond together more and we can all get some sun. I hope you can make it,” Lucien explained flatly.\n\nOh right…on top of all this mess, there’s that woman: Angela. Lucien’s fiancé, who last I saw was riding wilding on his cock...\n\n“Yes! Of course, I’ll be there! I can’t wait to go on a cruise with you. It’s been a long while since we’ve been on a getaway together after all,” I replied with fake enthusiasm. Although this time it won’t be just us alone on the trip, I added to myself in my mind. The conversation is clearly not headed in the direction that I want it to and I felt like getting away to clear my head…Oh that’s right…Zak.\n\n“I actually just remembered that I made plans to have a movie night with Zak at his house. I should be on my way, I don’t want him to wait for long. See you Lucien!” I said and mustering my courage I gave Lucien a kiss on his cheek, an act that I have not done for many years since I became aware of my feelings towards him. I turned and walked out from our mansion towards the mansion next door.\n\nLucien watched her walk away with a worried expression on his face. I guess she is still attached to that childhood friend of hers?",

As per usual, all the maids in this house have been instructed to leave me alone especially when I am with Zak.

He stroked my clit hard with his expert fingers and within a dozen thrusts, I climaxed once again throwing my head back screaming his name.\n\n“Are you alright down there?” I heard a husky calming voice coupled with a gentle hand stroking my hair.\n\n“Welcome back Zak…” I replied dreamily as I tried desperately to calm down from my orgasm. My normal Zak is back…finally. I thought my body would break before he returned.\n\n“Did he give you a hard time again? You look quite bruised and broken,” he said as he kissed me gently as his tongue gently probed my mouth open",

        "title": "Chapter 1. Found Her",
        "content": "Her Alpha Zane discovers that the girl his Beta found on pack terrain is his fated mate. But Mercedes is underage, coming from a nearby pack where the Alpha is known to be a very dubious figure. Zane realizes he'll have to wait until she's eighteen to claim her. Alpha Ahri grants permission for them to meet and bond until Mercedes also recognizes him as her fated mate. In the meantime, he ensures that she is trained for her position as Luna in his pack. Zane visits his mate more often in her pack and she spends as much time with him as possible. But then Alpha Ahri's son becomes jealous of the close bond between the two and tries to drive them apart. His father cooperates and forbids Zane further access to his pack and Mercedes is also no longer allowed to leave her home. To force her to accept his son as her mate, the Alpha accuses her father and Beta of the pack, of fraud and betrayal of the pack. These suspicions of high-ranking wolves carry the death penalty. Mercedes faces a choice, accept Alpha's son Glary or drive her father to death. She fears being completely at the mercy of the Alpha family.\n\n========\n\n‘Alpha, quickly, you really have to check this one out,’ my Beta screams in the mind link.\n\nI startle from my concentration and start to get irritated by this interruption. My desk is overflowing with work, I have a lot to catch up on. There is such a significant backlog, I'm still working myself to death here.\n\n‘What's up, Jace? I'm trying to get through some documents here,’ I explain to him. ‘Is it something you can't handle yourself?’ I urge him.\n\n‘Nah. You will never believe this. This is something that no pack has ever come across,' he replies, shocked.\n\nFor the first time, I hear shock, no, panic in Jace's voice. As pups, we literally said our first word, took our first steps at the same time and later went through the same combat training. And I've never once seen him scared of anything. Jace is the kind of wolf who has the solution to all problems and never hesitates to take action. His appearance is his greatest advantage, he radiates a strong authority no one dares to fuck with. No one has the courage to challenge or ignore him, his word can only be surpassed by mine. And that’s something never happened before. Given our deep friendship, he knows me well enough to know how to act in critical situations. So, we are totally in sync.\n\nThe fact that he now asks for my presence in the field means that World War III is probably near. In any case, he managed to get my full attention.\n\n'Tell me about it. And it must be really worth it now that you've distracted me from my work,\" I growl. ‘You won't believe this till you see it, man. This is the strangest thing I've seen since living in a pack. And that's all my life,’ he continues, still overwhelmed by whatever is happening at his side.\n\nStill staring at the pile of papers on my table, all I think about is killing this Beta if he’s wasting my time for nonsense. I slam my fist hard on the desk.\n\n‘Just keep me in the dark for one more minute and I swear to you, today is the last day your head is on top. I don't have time for rubbish, I yell furiously into the mind link.\n\n‘Zane, a pup has crossed our pack border. She says her name is Mercedes and she's from the Silver Moon pack,’ he finally explains, freezing me to horror. Damn, Silver Moon is more than fifty miles from here, how in the world could one of their pups end up at my border? That's impossible, someone must have brought her here. Did her parents banish her, I wonder? This is a very strange matter, I must investigate this personally. After that, I'll have to notify Alpha Ahri of this case. I doubt he'll be happy with my news.\n\n‘Keep her there, I'm on my way,’ I tell Jace. In all haste, I leave my office. This issue is of high priority, I have to resolve it the soonest. When I'm outside the packhouse, I strip and shift into my giant black wolf Jax. I take my clothes with me in my snout. It's a five-mile trip to the east border, with my speed I'll be there in five minutes. At high speed I pass tall trees, jump over bushes and stump until I am suddenly forced to a halt.\n\nA car track shows that people have been here. I sniff the air several times. Definitely intruders from Silver Moon, the girl's pack. And in recent months, I haven’t given anyone authorization to enter my pack. So, this is proof that someone purposefully brought the pup to my pack, she was not lost.\n\nThe case keeps getting weirder. In recent years, I have not read any messages in the Alpha WhatsApp group chat about human traffickers or kidnappings. There is also almost no question of switching pack members and trespassers. In this region, the packs are also no longer affected by rogues, thanks to our joint forces.\n\nA quick inventory reveals that members of Silver Moon entered my territory without permission and left a child here. I decide to continue on my way. Judging by my Beta's words, the child is in good spirits and talkative. She may be able to tell us more about those who left her here so that I can inform Alpha Ahri in more detail.\n\nAs I approach the clearing where my Beta, Head Warrior, and two fighters await me, a shiver runs down my spine. Immediately afterward, the delicious smell of Lemon mix strawberry infiltrates my nostrils, seducing me to search for it. I increase my speed, following the scent that leads me to the men.\n\nWhen I stand with them in wolf form, Jax eyes start to glow.\n\n'MATE!\" he exclaims.\n\nI shift and observe any of the men one by one. No, none of them is my mate and I'm hell sure not gay. No, certainly not me.\n\nThen my eyes drop down and I see her standing next to Jace. She tries to hide behind his long legs, but curious as she is, she bends her head to watch the scene.\n\nOur eyes clash and that is when I recognize her, my mate.\n\nI stare into the most beautiful silver eyes I've ever seen in my twenty years of existence. The girl's eyes are like marbles, looking bright and clear into the world. There is a contagious smile on her face.\n\nHer pitch-black hair is tied in a ponytail at her back.\n\n'MATE!' Jax growls again.\n\nMoon Goddess, really? What is this?..",

        "content": "In the short time, she has been in his company, the girl has put all her trust in Jace. She counts on his protection as she takes all the time to examine me.\n\nJealousy wells up in me.\n\n“Hi Alpha, my name is Mercedes”, she suddenly speaks up, her innocent marbles still pointed at me. Her voice is hoarse and soft, I could listen to that all day long. I get down on my knees to get a better look at her.\n\n“Mercedes. What a beautiful name you have. You can call me Zane, okay?”, I whisper to her. She smiles brightly at me and steps out of her hiding place.\n\n“Would you like to come with me to the packhouse, Mercedes? I want to ask you some questions about how you got here,\" I say still softly. \"And you must be hungry.\"\n\nShe nods eagerly, looks down for a moment and then back into my eyes.\n\n“But I don't have a wolf. Can I ride yours then?” she asks, clearly delighted at the prospect. \"What's your wolf's name?\"\n\n“My wolf's name is Jax. And he really loves to take you on his back”, I let her know. I get up and look at the men around me. Jake stares at me in disbelief and when I look at my Head Warrior Cleo, she is also uncomfortable with the situation.\n\n“Come with me to my office. I have some announcements to make. We leave here in wolf form”. I quickly shift again and Jax lays low for our mate. Deftly she climbs onto his back and holds on tightly. Obviously, she's done this many times before, I'll ask her more about this later.\n\nJax makes a bigger detour to the packhouse, enjoying the pup's joyful cries. Her black hair is blowing in the wind, she is urging him to go faster by hitting his flanks with her legs. But he wants to keep her safe and probably also wants to have her longer on his back and holds a moderate stride.\n\nHalf an hour later we reach the packhouse. Once Mercedes is off Jax's back, I go behind a tree to shift and get dressed. When I get back, I offer her my hand which she accepts without hesitation.\n\nJace and Cleo disappear for their own shift. We wait for them to return and walk to my study. I put Mercedes on the couch and sit next to her. Jake and Cleo both take a one-seater.\n\n“Jace here is my Beta, Mercedes. Tell me everything you told him when he found you. What is the name of your pack and how did you end up in the woods?” I ask in a low voice, all smiling. I don't want to scare her into holding back.\n\n“I don't know, Zane. I had fallen asleep and when I woke up, I saw Jace looking at me,\" she says smoothly. “I was in the woods behind the packhouse in my pack, I was playing with Marco and the others”.\n\nHer big innocent eyes stare into mine, and I am immediately convinced that she is telling the truth.\n\n\"That is good. And what are the names of your parents and your Alpha?” I ask her now.\n\n“Mommy's name is Selin and my daddy is Marc. They are the Beta of Alpha Ahri”, she replies fluently again. I look up to Jace, so her father is his colleague. The Betas in the region also stayed in contact in a digital chat group, so he could easily trace this information. He nods and takes his phone.\n\n“Who did you last see when you fell asleep in the woods?” I ask her. I take her hand in mine and press it encouragingly. She still stares at me as she shakes her head.\n\n“While we were playing, I tried to hide in the woods. Marco didn't come to catch me, so I laid down on the ground to wait. I haven't seen anyone,\" she says again. I understand that there is nothing left of her story, whoever kidnapped her has ensured that he remains unseen. But even then, the question remains, why would someone snatch a pup from her family?\n\n“Tell me, Mercedes. How old are you? Are you going to school already?” I now ask her with interest. She smiles wider, the school probably has good memories.\n\n\"I am ten years old. And yes, I'm in fifth grade. My teacher is Alyssa and she is very sweet”, she chirps. “She says I'm adorable too. She often gives me fruit that she brings from home. She says it's healthier than chocolate.\" I nod in agreement.\n\n“That's absolutely true. And if Alyssa gives you some of her own fruit, you must be her favorite student,” I compliment her. The smile couldn't be better, her eyes sparkle now.\n\n“Mercedes, would you like to come more often in my pack? During the school holidays or when you don't have homework in the weekends or something like that”, I ask her carefully.\n\nAs my mate, I must have her with me as often as possible. She's underage, so I know I'll have to wait until she's eighteen to claim her and officially make her my Luna. My biggest problem is my pack, Midnight Moon. Not only am I the most feared Alpha in this region, but I am also widely respected. The news that my mate is only a teenager isn't going to hit the pack well.\n\nAnd I will have to make it clear that I am by no means a pervert. By announcing my mate at her early age, the Moon Goddess prevented me from waiting too long for her and succumbing to the temptation to take a chosen mate and Luna. I look back at Mercedes, who can't take her eyes off me.\n\nCarefully I stretch out my hand and stroke her head. She doesn't flinch back from my touch, which means I’ve already gained her trust. That's the perfect start.\n\nNow I need to talk to her parents and the Alpha about this exceptional situation.\n\n“Yes, Zane. I'd like to live in the packhouse with you. But I have to ask my mom and dad first,\" she replies...",

        "content": "I take her hand and we all walk out of my office to the huge dining room. Fortunately, Jace had already mind linked the cook that we have a pup with us that needs to be fed.\n\nWhen we step inside, the smell of warm pancakes and syrups hits us. Mercedes lets go of my hand and runs to the table, clearly starving. I take her to the seat that has been vacant since I became the Alpha of this pack. I pick her up and place her in the Luna seat. Jace and the chief warrior watch with interest, holding their breath sharply but I don't pay attention to them at all. When I sit in my chair at the head of the table, I grab a plate and place a pancake on it.\n\n“Tell me, Mercedes, what syrup do you choose for your pancake? There is strawberry, caramel and pure honeybee”, I ask her. Delightful she eyes the pancake on the plate, I think my mate is a real foodie.\n\n“Honey, Zane. My mother always puts a lot on it for me”, she exclaimed enthusiastically. I sprinkle a generous amount on her pancake and cut it into smaller sections for her. When I give her a fork, she immediately digs in.\n\n“Thank you, Zane”, she says a moment later with a full mouth. I also pour her some fresh orange juice.\n\n“You're so welcome, little one”, I answer her. When I know she's comfortable, I start on my own portion.\n\n“Zane, we need to talk. There's more going on here,\" I hear Jace say. \"I'm starting to suspect what it is from the glow on your face.\" I look at my Beta and Head Warrior and nod. Once I've made sure that Mercedes is focused on her food, I turn back to the two at the dinner table.\n\n“Yes, she is my fated mate”, I confirm their suspicion. “Only the Moon Goddess knows why she paired me up with a pup, but I love her already and will make sure she stays in my life. Until she's of age to take her place as the Luna of Midnight Moon,\" I declare confidently. Jace looks at me thoughtfully.\n\n“You know Alpha Ahri is strict with his pack members,” he reminds me. \"You will have to be very convincing to make him believe that the pup belongs to you.\"\n\nYes, Jace is right. I am aware of that too.\n\nAhri is definitely a suspicious figure. He trusts no one and if any of his people get into trouble, even the lowest rank Omega, he is ready to start a war. And here we have his Beta's daughter, I know it's going to be tough talks to have my mate regularly in my pack. But he will have no choice but to allow me to be close to her, by Were laws, mates belong together. The only gripe he has is that she's underage, so I can't claim her and bring her to my pack. Until she is eighteen and also recognizes me as her mate, she must remain under Ahri's authority.\n\n“Zane, how old are you then? And where are your mommy and daddy?” Mercedes demands my attention again.\n\n“I'm twenty, Little one. My parents live in the other wing of the packhouse. And I have a younger sister Elise, the Head Warrior here is her mate”, I let her know. “Do you know what a mate is?”\n\nHer big round orbs are staring straight into my eyes again.\n\n“My mommy and daddy are mates. They kiss each other all day long,\" she says with a grin. “I often ask them why they kiss so much if they've had only one pup after all.”\n\nJace and Cleo burst out laughing at her words. Mercedes throws them a shy look.\n\n“Little one, who told you that mates get babies by kissing? The person lied to you, you have to trust me on that,\" Jace teases her, hiccupping with laughter. A serious look appears on my mate’s face.\n\n“Marco's parents have five pups and they also kiss the whole day. Marco says he often sees them without clothes in the house too,” she says wisely. I almost spit the pancake out of my mouth. Holy crap, what’s the matter with those people not locking their doors when they are on it?\n\n“Did he mention that to you? Maybe his parents would shift into their wolf at that time?” I suggest. If I run into this Marco, I'll have to teach him not to meddle in matters that concern grown-ups. He seems like a smartass who wants to initiate my mate in bedroom secrets way too early.\n\n“No, no, no, Zane”, she reproved, shaking her head. “Everyone shifts outside the house or in the woods. Never in a bedroom.” Now it is Cleo who can't hold back, he drops his head on the dining table to hide his laughter.\n\nOoohhh Goodness! I'm clearly not ready to follow the logic of a teenager. And then one who has a nosy friend as an example.\n\nI stare sternly at Cleo, who is struggling to get himself together. Jace also has a hard time keeping his face straight. In a frantic attempt to change the subject, I place another pancake on Mercedes' plate.\n\n\"Why don't you try the Strawberry syrup this time?\" She nods and with that, I have successfully shifted her attention. After eating all, Mercedes begins to yawn. Obviously, the past few hours have worn her down quite a bit.\n\n“Are you sleepy, Little one? Wait, I have my sister come over to pick you up. She will help you bathe and then you can rest for a few hours before your parents arrive to take you home,” I state. Happily, she shakes her head in agreement.\n\nI mind link Elise to report to the dining room.\n\n‘On my way, Alpha’, she answers immediately.\n\nWhen Elise enters the dining room, she walks straight to Mercedes.\n\n“Cleo told me we have a beautiful guest today in the pack”, she says beaming at my mate. “Hi, I'm Elise. This big Alpha here is my big brother. And you must be the sweet Mercedes.”\n\nMercedes nods shyly, watching Elise.\n\n“Can you bathe her and put her clean clothes on? Put her on my bed to sleep. She spent an entire evening outside of her pack. We fed her and now it's time for a nap,\" I explain to my sister. Elise takes her hand and as if they have known each other for years, the two leave the dining room chatting lightly.\n\nNow it’s finally time to have an in-depth discussion about the situation with my Beta and Head Warrior...",

        "content": "“Zane, I've reached Beta. He says his daughter has been missing since yesterday. She was indeed in the woods playing with some other pups when they couldn't find her anymore,” he tells me. “He is on his way here with his mate to pick her up himself. They'll be here in two hours.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't you let Alpha Ahri know about this?\" he asks.\n\nYes, I forgot about all that. The bliss of finally having my mate here has completely consumed my attention. I grab my phone and search my contact list for the number I need.\n\n“Alpha Ahri, Alpha Zane from Midnight Moon here. You must have heard that we found your Beta's daughter near our border,\" I let him know. The man on the other end of the line growled.\n\n“Alpha Zane. Yes, my Beta informed me. This matter should be thoroughly investigated. A pup cannot run miles in a day. There is more going on here.” He doesn't sound exactly indulgent as I expected.\n\n\"That's for sure. I discovered the scent of your pack on my territory. That means that some members of you have entered my land improperly,\" I tell him. “That is punishable. I look forward to including this in your research.” He puffs something but doesn't respond to my words. I decide not to push things through, my position is highly sensitive now that I am at the mercy of his decision in my personal affairs.\n\n“There's something else I want to discuss with you as well. It's unusual, but nobody knows the deliberations of the Moon Goddess”, I try to introduce him carefully to the matter. “Mercedes is my mate”, I drop the bomb.\n\n\"What!!\" he shouts into the speaker.\n\n“Dare you to put a finger on the pup and I'll make dogmeat of you! You pedophile. I'm coming for her with my warriors. And make sure she's safe and sound at the border. I'll kill you!\" he rages on. His breathing rasps through the phone, I can sense that his anger has reached the top.\n\n“Alpha Ahri, I can assure you that I am by no means a pedophile. And Mercedes' parents are on their way and will get their daughter back safe and sound”, I say calmly. “I don't intend to claim her yet, I know the Were laws too. I want to discuss this issue rationally and come to an agreement with you all.”\n\n\"Agreement? About what?\" Ahri sounds aggressive. I sigh deeply.\n\n“Listen, Mercedes is my fated mate. The Moon Goddess has decided this and I accept that. All I want is to be able to visit her in your pack and have her here with me, so she gets used to my presence and the pack. After all, she is the future Luna of the Midnight Moon pack”. I hear him swallow hard a few times, the news is clearly not easy for him to digest. But then there are two, I too have to get used to this unusual situation.\n\n“Alpha, you know the Were-laws too. It is forbidden to keep mates apart,” I remind him. \"I can assure you that she is safe here, my Beta makes sure that she lacks nothing here\". On the other end of the line, I eventually hear him take a deep breath, frantically trying to calm himself. Ahri is known as a hothead, it takes a lot to rationalize him. In the past Alpha meetings, he has made himself known as lightheaded, and few want to get involved with him. But I have no choice since my mate is from his pack.\n\n“Her parents are on their way. Talk to them and if they agree, I'll expect you in my pack within two weeks to discuss this matter further,\" he finally concedes. “But I still think this is an extraordinary case. First the girl is missing, then suddenly she is miles away in your pack and now she is your mate”. He pauses to enforce his words. “\n\nAre you sure you have nothing to do with the kidnapping of the pup?” he asks suspiciously.\n\nGoodness!! Can this man for once think logically?\n\nEven Mercedes does a better job here than her Alpha. And patience isn't exactly my forte. I suppress my annoyance, I have no more time to lose on this jackass.\n\n“Then explain to me what my motive would be? The girl is my mate. If I knew that beforehand, I would have just gone to her parents and then to you, as I do now,\" I explain to him as if I were talking to a toddler. “Why should I take the trouble to kidnap her first and then appear suspicious?” The Alpha notices my irritation and decides not to take it.\n\n\"What do you mean to tell me?\" he sounds tight. “Why wouldn't that be possible? Nowadays people do everything to get what they want. Who tells me you are an exception?”\n\nNo, no, no, I'm not going to waste my time on this nonsense. “Listen Alpha. As agreed, I will discuss the matter with her parents and be with you in a week. I'll let you know in advance when I arrive. I also hope to hear the results of your research.” Before he can say any more, I end the call.\n\nJace and Cleo stare at me pityingly. “Yes, this reaction was expected. The man is not known for his high IQ.”, sighs Jace. \"I can tell he was ready to declare war even before he had enough information about the situation.\" “\n\nThat would be a wrong decision on his part,” Cleo adds sarcastically. “Underestimating Midnight Moon and acting against the Were laws will be his end one day.”\n\nI walk to the liquor cabinet and take out my most expensive wine. There are now plenty of reasons to throw a three-man party. Midnight Moon has found its Luna and I have a mate. Maybe not quite the way I would like, but that doesn't affect my happiness. I give my friends a glass and toast each.\n\n“To a new beginning for Midnight Moon. With a Luna, we are much stronger, invincible”, I say in a fiery Alpha tone.\n\nJace and Cleo nod. The bubbles from our glasses rise while we look at each other confidently....",

When we step into my bedroom, we see Mercedes sleeping like an angel on my bed. Seeing her like this fills my heart with so much love for her.\n\nI immediately swore to myself that I would always protect her and make her happiness my number one priority. Elise has fallen asleep next to her but is up as soon as we arrive.\n\n“She was drained. While bathing her, she was already falling asleep,\" my sister whispers, not to wake Mercedes right away. She's slept for about two hours, probably not nearly enough to rest fully. But her parents are waiting, I have to convince them that their daughter is unharmed. I am well aware that I am under strict surveillance, everyone will want to know how I maintain the relationship with my mate. Carefully I sit down next to her.\n\n“Little one, you have to wake up now”, I say softly, stroking her face lightly. Slowly her eyes open and a happy smile crosses her lips. \"Zane\".\n\nShe sits up and wraps her arms around my neck. My wolf purrs with pleasure to have his mate so close.\n\n\"Did you sleep well? Go wash your face so we can meet your parents.\" I pick her up and put her on her feet. We wait for her to finish in the bathroom and then walk out of the room.\n\nMuch to my surprise, she grabs my hand and stands next to me in the elevator as we zip down.\n\n\"Are you still hungry, should I ask the cook to bring you some more?\" I ask her to hide my joy at her innocent act. She nods furiously, making us all smile.\n\nEveryone knows by now that eating is her favorite activity. I see Jace go straight into the mind link.\n\n“Well, the cook has counted on you to be hungry and has already prepared your Cereals,” he tells her. Immediately her face lights up as she looks happily at me. When we are on the main floor, we go straight to my office. There is a sitting area where Mercedes can eat her Cereals while I talk to her parents. When we are all seated, a servant brings the food. Immediately afterward, the Head Warrior enters with the parents.\n\nWe all get on our feet, I walk with outstretched hand to the Beta and his mate.\n\n“Welcome to Midnight Moon, Beta”, I greet them. \"As you can see, your daughter is safe here in my pack.\" I take them to the table where Mercedes is feasting on her meal. But when she notices her parents, she jumps around their necks in a joint embrace.\n\n“Daddy, Zane is so sweet to me. He says I can stay here on the holidays and weekends”, she exclaims enthusiastically. \"I told him I would ask you first.\" Her parents nod but remain silent.\n\n\"Why don't you stay here finishing your meal while we talk to the Alpha, sweetie?\" says her father. \"Then we can go home.\" Mercedes gives me a furtive look before returning to her food. The couple returns to my desk where I offer each a chair.\n\n“Beta Marc, Selin. We found your daughter at our pack site. We don't know how she got here, but I detected the scent of Silver Moon pack members on my land,\" I tell them. “I cannot confirm any connection to your daughter's disappearance. We are still investigating.” Beta Marc looks at me intently and I resist his gaze.\n\n“Alpha Ahri suggested that you kidnapped her and brought her here. And now you're claiming she's your fated mate,\" he declares in a high tone. His mate immediately takes his hand to calm him down.\n\n“Yes, as soon as my Beta informed me of his discovery, I went to the site. Never before has anything like this happened, at least I've never heard of a pup being found miles from home on its own.” I deliberately ignore the Beta's subtle accusation. He knows it is not his place to make such a comment, but he now has the advantage of being my father-in-law. Any other lower-ranking who had made such a comment in my presence would be already on their way to the morgue.\n\n“And I confirm that she is my fated mate. My wolf Jax recognized her as such. I hope he can convince your wolves too”, I tell him. “So, I have a proposal. You know that mates need to be together to strengthen their bond. Especially for me, it is important as an Alpha. My mate will not only strengthen me but also takes my pack into a better mental balance”.\n\n“And what's your suggestion, Alpha? My daughter is just a pup. The mating is only possible when she is eighteen,\" her mother now says with concern. Mercedes is a miniature of the woman sitting in front of me now, albeit with a conspicuous birthmark near one ear. She is probably of Alpha descent, from a different pack than Silver Moon. It is common for sisters of Alphas to mate with Betas of their own or from another pack.\n\n“I know that too. I don't have any plans to claim Mercedes before she's eighteen. Again, I'm a healthy man, not a pervert,\" I state dryly. “I propose to have Mercedes in Midnight Moon during the school and public holidays whenever there is an opportunity and she wants to. And I will visit her at your house. Until she's eighteen and she accepts me as her mate. Then we will have a grand Luna ceremony here in my pack”.\n\nMy thoughts drift to that moment in the future. An adult Mercedes comes on stage, our hands intertwined and is greeted enthusiastically by my pack as their Luna. In the meantime, we already have each other's marks. My heart is already beating at the prospect. I hear someone laughing softly and when I look up, I see a smiling Beta female Selin.\n\n“Alpha, my wolf agrees. And the look on your face at the prospect of my daughter accepting you at eighteen is priceless,\" she claims before turning to her mate. “Honey, the Alpha's offer is acceptable. If the Moon Goddess has arranged for them to meet this way, we shouldn't keep them apart. I do trust the Alpha.” Beta Marc looks at his mate doubtfully.\n\n“Indeed, I've never received negative reports about Midnight Moon with minors,” he admits reluctantly. “Let's let her come here on weekends first before she goes out for long periods,” he suggests.\n\nYes, that can do. I stare happily at my new in-laws. I stand up and shake hands with them both.\n\n“I assure you that you will never regret this. I will be in your pack in a week to confirm our agreement with Alpha Ahri.” In the mind link, I instruct Jace to prepare appropriate gifts for my in-laws while I have a meal with them in the dining room.\n\n“Beta, I insist you have lunch here with me. You would want to know more about me, know who your daughter's mate is,\" I suggest. Gratefully they accept my offer...",

I grin embarrassingly, knowing that the workouts in the morning are much more brutal and now I feel like I'm hiding from it.\n\nI look at the girls around me, they are all about my age, some are already eighteen, just like Jasmina. Speaking of Jasmina. She's staring straight at me now, but I'm ignoring her. As usual, she is with her group of worshipers who support her mindlessly in everything. “Maybe Mercedes just likes to sleep and do nothing,” one of the girls commented.\n\n\"Some",

        "title": "Book 1: When It Rains, It Pours",
        "content": "BOOK 1: BOUGHT BY THE ALPHA\n\nIsla\n\nRain pounds my back as I follow Alpha Ernest up the wide marble steps to a home I never expected to see in real life. I look around quickly, but he is walking fast, and I don’t have much time to see the outside of the mansion. I only know it resembles a castle. The dreary sky seems fitting, considering my bleak outlook.\n\nLikewise, this castle is fitting for an Alpha King.\n\nUnder the wide porch, there is a bit of shelter from the wind. I pull my thin cloak around my shoulders. When Alpha Ernest’s fist pounds on the door, I jump. Everything about this day is unexpected and has me on edge.\n\nThe door opens a bit, and a man with a thin, long nose gapes out at us. He is wearing a butler’s suit, and I relax only slightly.\n\nNot that I expected the cruel king to open his own door, but I am thankful not to be faced with him right away.\n\n“Greetings! Greetings!” Alpha Ernest says in his jovial, exceedingly loud voice. He laughs in the back of his throat, his gruff tone as raspy as the thunder in the distance. “It is I, Alpha Ernest of Willow pack! His Majesty is expecting me.”\n\nThe butler looks him over, and then his eyes fall on me for a moment as if he isn’t sure whether or not the rotund, sweaty man in the white shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows could possibly be an actual Alpha. The detail of the Omegas that are hanging out in the car that brought us the two hours make it more convincing.\n\n“Come in,” the butler says, pulling the heavy wooden door open.\n\n“Thank you, thank you,” my Alpha says, and I follow him inside, absently wondering why he must say everything twice.\n\nMy happiness at being let in from the rain only lasts a moment as I follow along behind the two men who walk quickly down a long corridor. The inside of the house doesn’t resemble the castle in the sense that the floors are not made of stone—they are wood—and the walls are covered in drywall. But it is a huge building, and it is lavishly decorated with fine furnishings, all kinds of pieces of art from paintings to sculptures to ancient vases, and I try to keep up with our guide while my eyes roam over objects that are worth a hundred times more than what my parents make in a year—a thousand times more.\n\nThe sale of just one of these objects would have been plenty to pay off my parents’ debts. If I’d had just one painting to sell, I wouldn’t be here now.\n\nI can’t think of that at the moment. My fate is sealed. I grasp my small bag in my hands and struggle to keep up. It doesn’t help that I haven’t eaten much of anything in the past week. I feel lightheaded.\n\nWe turn down a few corridors, and it’s clear to me that we are now in the part of the building that is for work instead of show. Artwork still hangs on the walls, but it’s not as elaborate. The doors we are passing seem to be offices, not libraries or parlors.\n\n“Wait here,” the butler says, pausing outside of a closed door. He knocks, and I hear a low, gravelly voice call him in.\n\nI feel my heart begin to thump in my chest. I’m still not quite clear what Alpha Ernest has in mind for me. When I came to him for help earlier in the day, he asked me a few personal questions; a smile split his face, and then he told me to go home and pack all of my most prized possessions. He said to tell my family goodbye if I was serious about paying off my family’s debts and to be back in his office in one hour.\n\nThen, we’d gotten in the car and driven here. I hadn’t asked any questions other than for him to put it in writing.\n\n“John and Constance Moon are no longer in debt to Alpha Ernest Rock if their daughter, Isla Moon, follows through with the agreement made with said Alpha on this day…” Dated, signed by both parties, and here I am.\n\nStill not sure what that agreement is.\n\nAlpha Ernest goes inside of the office, and I am tempted to strain to see inside, too, but I don’t. I’ve never seen him before, the Alpha King, the head of all of the Alphas and all of the territories in our region, for thousands and thousands of miles. I’ve heard lots of stories about him, though.\n\nPresently, I am hoping that most of them are not true.\n\nI would like to see his face, to know if the rumors of his attractiveness are accurate.\n\nBut I’d rather not see him at all if I had a choice. Word of his cruelty proceeds him, and it is said that he is just as brutal as he is handsome.\n\n“You may sit,” the butler says, gesturing to a chair near the door that has closed behind Alpha Ernest.\n\nI nod, but I am not capable of thanking him verbally right now, not when my teeth are near chattering with fear.\n\nI sit down, still grasping my bag in my hands. I wish I had put on more than the thin cloak my mother had given me last winter. Cloaks were cheaper than coats, so that’s what I had.\n\nI wouldn’t hide the trembling that was beginning to ravage my body, though.\n\nDoing my best to ignore the shaking, I tried to focus on the faint voices I could hear coming from behind the thick wooden door. I didn’t expect to be able to hear because the door looked sturdy, but Alpha Ernest was loud.\n\nAnd Alpha Maddox…Well, he just sounded agitated.\n\n“Thank you for seeing me on such short notice,” Alpha Ernest was saying.\n\nWhen Alpha Maddox replied, it was harder to hear. He wasn’t as loud. “I don’t know why you’re here unless it’s to pay me the money you owe me.” At least, that’s what I think he was saying.\n\n“Unfortunately, sir, I don’t have the money—not exactly,” the other man replies. I hear Alpha Maddox grumble in response. “But I have something else to offer you instead. Something better.”\n\n“Something better than the one and a half million dollars you owe me?”\n\nMy heart catches in my throat, and I nearly choke. One and a half million dollars? Did I hear that correctly? What in the world could Alpha Ernest have that is worth that kind of money?\n\n“Oh, yes!” Alpha Ernest says. “Please, sir, hear me out. I have a bargain for you. One that will allow me to settle our debt and help you with a certain…problem you have.”\n\nProblem? What problem could Alpha Maddox possibly have—other than the fact that he might have killed all of the people that he wanted to yell at.\n\nI sit with my feet flat on the floor, my eyes focusing on the eggshell wall across from me, listening, not believing what I am hearing.\n\n“Ernest,” Alpha Maddox says, “you are the last person on earth I would turn to to help me solve a problem, not that I even know what you’re referring to.”\n\n“Let me enlighten you, sir, if you don’t mind?”\n\nAlpha Maddox growls again. If he says anything else, I don’t hear it.\n\nAlpha Ernest continues. “You have just turned twenty-nine last month, yes?” I assume Alpha Maddox confirms this because my pack Alpha continues. “Everyone knows that the Alpha King is expected to have an heir by the age of thirty.”\n\n“Alpha Ernest—” the king says.\n\n“Give me only a few moments of your time, Alpha,” Ernest says, and I can imagine his hands up in front of him. “You need someone who can bear you a child, someone with no complicated relationship involved, someone who is beautiful, with good, healthy genes. A strapping mother who has born many children and proven herself to be from good stock.”\n\nWith every word he speaks, my heart leaps higher into my throat, even though my brain still doesn’t want to compute what he is saying.\n\n“What are you proposing, Ernest?” Alpha Maddox says. “I don’t have any problem picking up women. You know that, don’t you?”\n\n“Yes, yes, of course!” Alpha Ernest says. “But women at court are complicated. They have expectations. I know you don’t intend to marry again. So… what you need is a willing, compliant, beautiful girl who is eager to spread her legs to earn money, bear you a child—or two or three—and then fade away. And I have just the girl for you.”\n\nI take a deep breath and hold it. Surely, Alpha Maddox will not agree to this. Why would he agree to this?\n\nWhy have I agreed to this?\n\nDid I agree to this?\n\n“Let me see if I understand you correctly, Alpha Ernest,” I hear Alpha Maddox say, and I can’t tell if he’s angry, offended… or intrigued. “Are you proposing I take some girl you’ve brought with you into my home for the sole purpose of having a child?”\n\n“That’s right, Your Majesty,” Ernest says. “I’m proposing you take on… a breeder.”",

        "content": "Maddox\n\nI hear the word come out of Alpha Ernest's mouth, watch his gums flap as his fat cheeks shift into a smile, his greasy mustache dancing as he tips his head up and blinks at me.\n\nHe's like a shoddy used car salesman, trying to convince me to take something I don't want or need.\n\nSomething that's broken and doesn't even work correctly—something that will never serve its intended purpose.\n\nWhat he doesn't know is that I've already been considering finding a breeder for the last few months. I just haven't had the time to try to find a woman who would fit the requirements.\n\nEverything he's said is true. I certainly don't ever want to marry again, no matter what. Even thinking about my wife makes my heart tighten up, and my eyes begin to water. I have to push her beautiful face from my mind immediately. No, I will not ever take another bride.\n\nThat means, in order to have an heir, I have to find a woman who'd be willing to carry my child knowing that there are no strings attached.\n\nThat simply cannot happen with any of the women at court. They all want something more.\n\nThey all want me.\n\nFinding a woman from one of the other pack lands has always been a possibility, and I've had a few Alphas mention their daughters from time to time, but I've never wanted to put a loyal Alpha in a position where I'd be using their daughter in such a manner. Whoever carries my child will essentially be unable to ever marry and have a normal life.\n\nWhat other man would ever want her? Even if she found her fated mate, he'd know that she'd been with me, the Alpha King, and he'd never, ever be able to live up to those standards.\n\nShe'd live the rest of her life by herself, discarded and alone.\n\nWho would want that?\n\nApparently, Alpha Ernest has found someone who won't mind. I need to know more.\n\n\"Who is the girl?\" I ask, trying not to sound too interested, like I am humoring him. It isn't too hard for me. My reputation for being abundantly cruel isn't completely unfounded.\n\n\"Her name is Isla Moon, Alpha Maddox. She is a member of my pack. Today, she came in and asked if I had any odd jobs she could do to pay off the debt she owes me, and I offered her this one. She accepted.\"\n\nHe is holding something back. I can tell by the way his eyes are wide, the way he shrugs his shoulders as he speaks. There has to be more to Isla's story than this. \"Why does she owe you money?\" I ask him.\n\nHe only shrugs. \"Family debt. I'm not sure.\"\n\nI study his face. He is lying. He knows exactly what it is. I wonder if the girl has been manipulated to be here or if she came of her own free will. Had she heard about the handsome, mysterious Alpha King and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to spend some time in his castle and frequent his bed?\n\nI also want to make sure she isn't some prostitute who is going to make me sick. \"Has she been… inspected?\"\n\n\"No,\" he says. \"But that's not necessary. The girl is a virgin.\"\n\nI scoffed. \"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I've known her for her entire life,\" he says quickly. \"My pack is small. I know everyone. Of course, if you are worried, you can send your physicians in to see. If I am lying, I would gladly pay you twice what I owe you, sir. I would never deceive you about such a thing.\" I raise my eyebrows. He realizes he slipped up. \"I would never deceive you about anything.\"\n\nSomehow, I doubt that. \"What does she look like?\" I ask.\n\n\"She's beautiful,\" he tells me. \"She's outside the door.\"\n\nI shake my head. I don't want to see her yet.\n\n\"She's a small girl, about this tall.\" He raises his hand to show me she's about five foot two or so. \"She has long, blonde hair that is curly, and her eyes are wide and blue. Her skin is smooth, like porcelain, and bright. She's a bit skinny, I think, but she has large breasts and curvy hips.\"\n\nI close my eyes and slowly shake my head at his crassness. It shouldn't surprise me. I wonder if the girl can hear us.\n\n\"Is she intelligent?\" I don't want my heir to be an idiot.\n\n\"Oh, yes. She did very well in school. Top of her class. She went to college for a couple of years but had to drop out for… some reason.\" Again, he is holding back. He knows why. \"She's a sweet girl. You will enjoy her.\" He winks at me, and I know he means sexually.\n\nIt makes my skin crawl because I know he wishes that he could enjoy her.\n\nI don't know why the girl has decided to come with him here, but I won't be sending her back home with him, not today anyway.\n\nI have a lot to do today, including a dinner party with an Alpha from a distant region. I decide I will keep her and possibly speak to her for a bit before I determine what to do. While it does sound like her services may be the solution to my problems, I'm not sure I'm ready for all of these complications.\n\n\"How old is she?\" I ask him.\n\n\"Twenty, I think,\" he says.\n\nTwenty. She is young. When I was twenty, my father was still alive. I wasn't even the Alpha King yet.\n\nIt seems like a very long time ago.\n\nThe image of my wife's face flutters in front of my mind, and my mouth wants to move of its own accord.\n\n\"Rebecca…\"\n\nI don't say her name. I've learned not to. It makes people question my sanity, and since they already do that enough over my alleged viciousness, there's no reason to have them think I'm seeing ghosts as well.\n\nIf there's one thing they don't need to worry about, it's me seeing Rebecca. I've looked everywhere for her and have never seen her, not even once.\n\nNot even in my dreams.\n\n\"What do you say, Alpha Maddox? Why don't we make this agreement? Take the girl. Enjoy her. If she gets pregnant and gives you an heir in the next year, my debts are erased. If she does not… I will find another way to repay you… plus interest.\"\n\nAlpha Ernest extends his hand to me. I take a deep breath and look at his palm, not sure whether I should shake his hand or not.\n\nDo I want to take the girl and keep her as a breeder—or send her back home with this man, possibly to her family, or possibly to become some sort of sex slave to him?",

        "content": "Isla\n\n\"This way. Keep up, and don't touch anything.\"\n\nI follow along behind the tall, middle-aged, blonde woman in a suit as she walks very quickly through the castle. She's wearing a pair of gray slacks and a black jacket, the shirt beneath with a white collar that's buttoned up to her chin. Her hair is in a tight bun, and she has her nose in the air. She seems very proper, and I don't think she's very nice.\n\nI keep thinking about that word. Breeder. What does it mean? Why am I here?\n\nI do my best to keep up, but she's walking so fast, and I have no idea where we are going or why we are going there. I didn't hear much of the conversation between Alpha Ernest and Alpha Maddox. Once Alpha Ernest offered to sell me to Alpha Maddox to get rid of his debts, they began to negotiate much quieter, and I don't know what's happening now.\n\nI walk through narrow halls, through larger openings that have pieces of artwork like vases and paintings, and even some suits of armor. Everything is regal and expensive as it had been before, and I wouldn't touch anything even if she hadn't told me to because I am afraid I might break something.\n\nEverything here looks like it is worth more than my family makes in a year.\n\n\"I have no idea why Mr. Thompson, the butler, has asked me to show you to this room,\" the woman says as I follow along, carrying my bag in front of me and trying to keep up. \"But apparently, the king has asked him to. I, personally, think it must be a mistake, judging by how you're dressed.\"\n\nMy eyes immediately drop down to see what I am wearing, and I remember that I didn't have much time to get ready to go on this journey. I am still wearing a black skirt and white blouse I had put on for work this morning under my black cloak. My shoes are old tennis shoes that have a hole in one toe, and because they are wet from the rain, they squeak a little. I'm sure she loves that.\n\n\"I asked him if he meant for me to show you to the maids' quarters, but he said no. I was to show you to this suite. Whatever in heaven's name the king has in mind for you, it's none of my business, but perhaps he's got it in his head that you're from Alpha Jordan's pack, Maple pack, though none of them have arrived yet. I'll set him straight in a bit.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I say, trying to be polite.\n\nShe stops and spins around, her dark eyes like daggers. \"I am the head of the staff here at Castle Blackthorn. You will address me as Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire. Do you understand me?\"\n\nI stare at her for a long moment, wondering why she would address a guest in such a way. Her eyes are wild, and I imagine a maid would get a slap across the face for such an offense. I'm not even sure how to answer since I'm quite certain I cannot repeat that name.\n\nI most certainly will not say, \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nSo, instead, I nod my head. \"Beg your pardon,\" I say.\n\nShe continues to stare at me for what seems like a minute or two before she says, \"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire.\"\n\nI clear my throat and say, \"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Worsthingshurtinshirthenshire.\"\n\nShe takes a deep breath and blows it out slowly. \"Worthingshorethinshire. It's not that difficult!\"\n\nI am afraid she's going to make me try to say it again, but she doesn't. Instead, she spins around and starts walking once more, and I follow, feeling sorry for the maids who have to answer to her and attempting to practice her name as I go.\n\nI do not like her at all, this Mrs. Worsthingstirshorethinsire… or whatever her name is.\n\nAnd I just want to go home.\n\n\"Your room, for now, is just down the hall from the king's room. But don't expect it to stay that way. Because, as I said, I believe there has been a mistake.\"\n\nWe round a corner quickly, and I run into a table. The contents, a silver bowl, and a vase, clatter, and she turns around and comes at me. \"Be careful!\" she shouts.\n\n\"I'm so sorry!\" I say, praying that nothing falls.\n\nShe rights the bowl and steadies the vase, shaking her head as she does so. \"I told you not to touch anything. If that happens again, you're going to wish you never stepped foot in this castle! I don't care who you are or why you're here, young lady! In my castle, under my watch, there are consequences for breaking the rules!\"\n\nI take a step backward, feeling myself shrink a bit with each shout. I know I must try to say her name again as she towers over me, her face red with rage.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Worthersthershirhirethire.\"\n\n\"That's not even close!\" she screams in my face. \"You're incorrigible, aren't you? It's no wonder someone brought you here and left you!\"\n\nI wonder how she knows that, but I say nothing, only watch the veins in her neck protrude.\n\nI have seen that before, right before my boss at the flour mill would hit me because I dropped a bag or before my boss at the diner would beat me for accidentally spilling a tray of food. I'm not clumsy, but I'm not that strong. Eventually, after working eighteen or nineteen hours, I would grow tired, and things would slip.\n\nI am afraid she's going to hit me now, but she doesn't. She only walks a few more steps before she produces a key and unlocks a door.\n\nWe walk inside what must be an antechamber because there's another door. This room is mostly empty. Just a little sitting area and a table with another vase on it. It's quaint and pretty.\n\nShe props the main door open with a doorstop and then continues. \"These are your rooms, for now,\" she says, leading me to the other door.\n\nAs she pushes the other door open, I step aside and bump the table slightly with my hip. I think nothing of it, though, because these are my rooms.\n\nUntil I feel pain radiating through the side of my face and am knocked off my feet, falling to the floor as my bag goes flying free from my hands so that I can try to catch myself.\n\n\"I told you not to touch anything!\" she screams at me.\n\nShocked, I sit there on the floor for a moment, trying to grasp what has just happened. Did she just hit me for bumping a table in my own chambers?\n\nAm I not supposed to sleep in the bed the king has appointed for me?\n\nOr sit on any chairs?\n\nBefore I can react, she reaches down and grabs me by the collar of my cloak, yanking me to my feet. She is so much bigger than me, and stronger. She is shaking me as she screams, \"Who do you think you are, coming in here and messing things up? You little tramp?\" She slaps me again, and this time, I manage to get my arm up to partially block it, but I still feel her hand make contact with my cheek. Over and over again, she swings at me, and it's all I can do to keep her from knocking me down again.\n\nUntil I hear a commanding voice shout, \"What on earth are you doing?\"",

        "content": "Isla\n\nThe head maid lets go of me when we hear a male voice demanding to know what she is doing.\n\nShe turns to address him as I cover my face, pain radiating through my cheeks and nose.\n\n\"Beta Seth,\" she begins, \"this girl was being careless with the king's belongings and disrespectful to me. I was simply teaching her a lesson, the same way I would teach any new servant a lesson, sir.\"\n\nI wipe a bit of blood from my upper lip with the back of my hand and turn to see a handsome man walk into the room. He is tall, with dark blond hair and white shoulders. His green eyes are focused on the other woman in the room, and his intense stare wavers her rigid stance.\n\n\"How dare you?\" he demands. \"You were asked to show Miss Isla to her room, Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire. No one asked you to teach her anything. I can't imagine she did anything careless. What could she have possibly done? I didn't see anything broken between here and the king's offices.\"\n\nI watch as the woman's throat moves viciously as she swallows. \"Well, she bumped a table in the hall and then again in here and…\"\n\n\"In her own room? So what?\" He seems to be getting angrier by the moment, and as he takes another step toward her, Mrs. Whateverhernameisshire bumps into the table. \"I suppose now that you've bumped the table, we should teach you a lesson, hmm?\"\n\nI notice then that there are two other men with him. Both of them are dressed in guards' uniforms. They are large, muscular men as well, and as Beta Seth raises a hand, they step forward.\n\n\"Oh, no, Beta, please,\" she says. \"I didn't mean to.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure Miss Isla didn't mean to either. But you took it upon yourself to slap her until her face was bleeding. So… I think Daniel and Stephen shall do the same to you.\" He snaps his fingers and moves aside.\n\nI watch as one of the large men grabs her by the collar, and the other begins to slap her across the face. It only takes a few smacks for her nose and lip to start bleeding. She begins to cry, begging them to stop.\n\n\"Please,\" I say, my eyes wide. \"Please, don't.\" I reach out to touch the Beta's shirt sleeve, but I fall short of actually grabbing it. \"Can that be enough, please?\"\n\nHe turns and looks at me while the other two continue to slap her, taking turns now. He snaps his fingers and they stop, letting her go in the process, and she falls to the ground. \"You think she's had enough, Miss Isla?\"\n\nI nod. I wouldn't have wanted them to slap her anyway. Even though she is an awful person, and she hurt me, I don't like to watch others suffer.\n\nHe studies my face for a moment before one side of his mouth pulls up into a grin.\n\n\"You are… different,\" he assesses, and I don't know if that's good or bad. \"Daniel, take Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire to her chamber to gather her things. She'll be departing the castle now.\"\n\n\"Yes, Beta Seth,\" Daniel says, and he hauls the woman up off the ground by her shirt collar as she begs to keep her job.\n\n\"You're firing her?\" I ask.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answers as if it is the most obvious thing in the world. \"You haven't even seen your room yet. Here we are.\"\n\nI feel bad for the woman, even if she was a witch, but we have moved on, and as Beta Seth opens the door to my room, I can't believe my eyes.\n\n\"This is… my room?\" I ask.\n\n\"That's right,\" he tells me. \"King Maddox wanted the best room for you.\"\n\nI stand in the doorway for a moment and take it all in.\n\nTo my left, there's a large, cherry wood dresser with a beautiful mirror and a bench where I can sit and do my hair and makeup, if I had any makeup. Just down from there is a plush blue chair that looks cozy and inviting. A large window with drapes the same shade as the chair is next to it, and there's a matching one on the other side of the bed.\n\nThe bed is massive, big enough for at least three people. It is a four-poster bed in the same cherry wood as the dresser, and the bedding matches the rest of the fabrics in the room. The mattress looks so plush and divine; I can't wait to try it out. I've been sleeping on a thin piece of foam for so long that I can't remember what a real mattress feels like\n\nNext to the second window, there's a door, which stands ajar, and I can see that inside is a bathroom, and a clawfoot tub looks so inviting, I want to jump right in. The tile on the floor is black and white checkered, and it looks very sleek and polished inside the en suite bathroom.\n\nThere's a large fireplace, though it isn't lit at the moment. The mantel has some beautiful blue vases, and over it is a cottage scene that I imagine I could stare at for hours.\n\nNear the fireplace stands a larger armoire that matches the other furniture, and there's another door that I imagine is a closet.\n\nIn the corner to my left is a round table in the same cherry wood finish with four chairs, upholstered in the same blue.\n\nThe carpet is beige, but there's a large throw rug that has beige and blue woven through it.\n\n\"Well?\" Beta Seth asks as I stand there gaping at all of this.\n\n\"I think that Mrs. Worthershtirshirehover was right,\" I say, noting that he is chuckling at my butchering of her name.\n\n\"What did Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire say, dare I ask?\" Beta Seth questions.\n\n\"She told me that she thought there's been some mistake and that I'm actually supposed to be shown to the maid's quarters. Beta Seth, sir,\" I begin, bowing my head in respect, \"I went to my Alpha to borrow money to repay a debt, and he brought me here to repay a debt he owes to the king. I believe I should be working to pay that debt off. Shouldn't I be in the maids' quarters to do that?\"\n\nBeta Seth's smile fades. \"No one told you then?\" he asks me.\n\nMy eyebrows raise, and I feel my heart begin to thunder in my chest as I try to guess what his words are supposed to mean. \"No one told me… what?\" I ask.\n\n\"No one told you what your duties shall be… in order to pay off the debt?\"\n\nI shake my head. \"No, sir. No one has told me.\"\n\nHe clears his throat. \"I don't really want to be the one to tell you, but if it isn't going to be King Maddox himself, then I suppose it's going to be me.\"\n\n\"Please, sir. You've been so kind. I'd like to hear it from you if you don't mind.\"\n\nHe nods, and I brace myself to hear what he has to say. I have no idea what it could possibly be. None at all.\n\n\"You're going to repay your debts by becoming the Alpha King's Breeder.\"\n\nI nod—but I'm still lost, and I don't know how to tell him.",

        "content": "Maddox\n\nI need to prepare for my meeting with Alpha Jordan’s pack before the formal dinner we’ll be having. We have many points to discuss, and I need to be on top of my game to make sure that I don’t get swindled on any of them.\n\nAfter all, Alpha Jordan is one of my strongest allies, but he’s also quite shrewd and nearly twice my age.\n\nIt would be quite easy for him to take advantage of me if I’m not paying close attention.\n\nBut I can’t get my mind off the girl, and that’s irritating.\n\nI’ve sworn not to ever take another Luna, so there’s no need for me to even let that thought cross my mind. It’s not that.\n\nI just wonder… what is she doing here? And am I crazy for even letting Alpha Ernest’s ridiculous suggestion enter my thoughts?\n\nBreeder…\n\nI had been thinking about it before, though. It used to be common practice a long time ago, back when Lunas had trouble conceiving male heirs, and Alphas wanted to make sure that they had a strong son to put on the throne or to rule the pack after them.\n\nJust because I hadn’t heard of anyone doing it in decades didn’t mean it wasn’t a good idea.\n\nStill… the girl…\n\nI’d only caught a glimpse of her as she’d gone down the hallway, and she hadn’t seen me at all. I hadn’t even seen her face.\n\nAlpha Ernest had said she was beautiful, but that didn’t mean anything. Beauty was in the eye of the beholder.\n\nBeyond that, I had a reputation for being a cold, cruel man on the battlefield.\n\nCould I also be one in the bedroom?\n\nPeople spoke of me as if I had a harem of women that I used and abused, but the truth of the matter was I hadn’t slept with many women at all since my wife had died. When I did, they knew that there were no feelings involved.\n\n“Rebecca…”\n\nHer name rolled from my lips so easily, even though I wished it wouldn’t. Even when I wished her memory would fade to the back of my mind and simply become a part of my subconscious.\n\nA knock on my door brought me out of my thoughts.\n\n“Seth,” I said, seeing my Beta walk into the office. He knew he could walk in any time I wasn’t with someone else. “Did you check on our… new guest?”\n\n“I did. She’s… a tiny thing. Sweet—a bit odd, perhaps.”\n\n“Odd?”\n\nHe shrugged. “It’s hard to describe. You’ll have to meet her. She’s quite lovely, though. At any rate, it isn’t her I came by to tell you about.”\n\nWith my elbows on my desk, I leaned toward him. “What is it then?”\n\n“It’s Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire.” Seth let out a lamentable sigh as he sat down in a chair across from me. “I’m afraid I’ve had to let her go.”\n\n“Let her go?” I repeat. “But she’s the head of the house staff, the head of the maids anyway. Whatever for?”\n\n“Well, when I walked into the room, she had slapped the girl, Miss Isla, so hard, she’d knocked her across the room, and when I asked Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire why, she said it was because the girl had knocked into a table in her own room. Naturally, I couldn’t let that be tolerated. It’s not the first time I’ve heard of Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire doing something so cruel.”\n\nI can only stare at him for a moment, hardly believing my ears. “And I have the reputation for being brutal.”\n\nHe nodded. “I was so infuriated at the sight, I had my men give her a taste of her own medicine.” He looks down at the floor, a bit embarrassed, I think. “Maybe I shouldn’t have, but I thought she deserved it.”\n\n“No, don’t beat yourself up about it,” I say, trying to crack a joke, but Seth doesn’t seem to think I am funny right now. “You did the right thing. How is the girl?”\n\n“I left her in her rooms. I have sent for Poppy. I think she’s the right maid to take care of her. I will also have some dinner sent to her and a wardrobe. I assume you will be in to see her… eventually?”\n\nI shrug. “I don’t know what my plans are, Seth. This breeder business… it’s probably not for me. Especially if she is as you say she is… tiny and frail.”\n\n“Well, she is tiny, but I don’t think she is frail. And she is quite lovely. There’s something about her that’s quite striking—and before you say it—no pun intended.” He gives me a look that says he likes me better when I’m not trying to be funny.\n\n“Is that what’s odd about her then? The striking part?” I ask, putting my strange sense of humor aside.\n\n“No,” he says. “I think what’s odd was that she just took it, like she’s used to being knocked around. And that sort of seemed sad to me. That someone so young should be so used to being hit so hard.”\n\nI can only shrug at that. Empathy is not my strong suit. “Thanks for letting me know,” I say. “Alpha Jordan will be here soon, and I need to prepare.”\n\n“All right,” Seth gets up and heads out of the room, and I go back to my notes about my meeting with Alpha Jordan, but I cannot concentrate at all.\n\nAll I can think about is the girl.",

        "content": "Isla\n\nI sit on the bed in my new room, not sure what to do, grasping my bag. I look around, but I’m not sure what to do.\n\nWhy am I here?\n\nIf I touch anything else, will someone come flying out of the closet and slap me again?\n\nBeta Seth has assured me that this is my room and I can do whatever I want, but I am still hesitant. I can’t help but think that this is all a huge mistake.\n\nMrs. Worchestshire, or whatever her name was, had mentioned that she thought I was meant to go to the maids’ quarters, and while Beta Seth said that wasn’t right, I can’t help but think maybe someone will come and take me there soon.\n\nIf I get too comfortable in here, I will just have to go.\n\nAnd this is the nicest room I’ve ever seen.\n\nI haven’t been sitting here too long when there is a knock at the door.\n\nI look up, and a girl with brown hair and wide hazel eyes is staring at me, just her head sticking in the door.\n\n“Hello, Miss,” she says. “May I come in?”\n\n“Yes, of course,” I say, starting to get up.\n\n“Oh, no, don’t get up!” she insists, flying into the room like a flurry, a small, contained tornado. “I’m Poppy, Miss Isla,” she says with a small bow of her head. “How do you do?”\n\nI hesitate to respond because I’m not used to being addressed this way, but then I say, “I’m f-fine, thank you.”\n\n“Good! Beta Seth sent me to take care of you. I will be your personal maid. So… what can I do to assist you, miss?” she asks, standing at attention with her hands folded in front of her.\n\nI don’t know how to respond to her because I have never had anyone bring me anything in my life, not since I was a child and needed my mother’s help. “I don’t know,” I admit to her. “Do… do you know why I’m here?” The last part is a whisper.\n\nPoppy laughs, and it sounds a bit like a melody. “No, miss, I’m afraid not. But don’t fret. I’m sure there’s a good reason if you don’t know. Now, let’s see… Food is on its way from the kitchen. A meal should be arriving shortly. Is that your bag?”\n\nI look down at the pathetic bag I’m clutching in my hands, my knuckles white, and I nod.\n\n“May I?” she asks, extending a hand.\n\nI don’t want to let go of it, but I do. She takes the bag from me, and looks through it.\n\n“All right,” she says. “We have plenty of clothes in the castle. We keep them in case guests forget their bags. Or so they say.” She takes my things over to the armoire and begins to put them away. “Although, I have to say, I think it’s also in case they are robbed on their way to the castle. You know there are plenty of rogues out there. And some Alphas who can’t seem to remember who is king.” She shakes her head, and I am surprised. I didn’t know that there were any Alphas who would rise up against the Alpha King.\n\n“At any rate, I will go and get you more clothing. You should have a regal wardrobe. I will get what I can, but we will see that you have everything that you need. Beta Seth said that you are to be treated as the finest ladies in the castle.”\n\nMy eyes bulge. “He did?”\n\n“Yes, he did. Now, what size are you?”\n\nI have no idea. I shake my head. “My mother makes my clothes.”\n\n“Well, do you mind standing up?”\n\nI manage to slide off the bed, and she looks me up and down.\n\n“Tiny thing, aren’t you!” Poppy proclaims.\n\nShe is rather thin herself, but she is much taller than me. My hands are trembling a bit, and I don’t know what to do with myself. I’ve only been here a few hours, and I already miss my family.\n\n“What happened to your face?” she asked, staring at the spot where that woman hit me.\n\nI can only shake my head. I don’t want to tell her.\n\n“Oh! That’s why they hauled Mrs. W. out of here by her hair, isn’t it?”\n\n“By her hair?” I ask, my eyes wide. I can hardly believe it.\n\n“Yes! She deserved it anyway, awful witch! She treated everyone like that.” Poppy shook her head. “Well, it’s good she’s gone. Now, why don’t I go draw you a hot bath so you can soak? You’ve had a long day. Then, I’ll go get you something proper to wear, and you can eat something and lie down.”\n\n“All right,” I mutter, even though I’m fairly certain the king himself will be in soon to tell me it’s time for me to go home—or go to the maids’ quarters.\n\nPoppy goes into the bathroom, and soon enough, I hear water running and smell roses. She comes back a moment later with a big grin on her face. “Do you need any help getting undressed?”\n\n“No, thank you,” I say. I can’t imagine needing help with that.\n\nRich people are… strange.\n\n“All right. Do you need anything else before I go?”\n\n“No, thank you.”\n\nShe smiles at me and says, “I’ll be back soon.”\n\n“Thank you, Poppy,” I say before she goes.\n\nShe nods and then heads for the door, and I can’t help but think that we might be friends—if I stay here.\n\nEven if I do end up being a maid.",

        "content": "Maddox\n\n“Alpha Jordan?” I say, eyeing the man across from me and wondering what he’s doing in my office when we are meant to have dinner in less than two hours. “What is it that you need?”\n\nHe looks at me, and a small chuckle escapes his lips as he rubs his chin with a fist. He’s at least twenty-five years my senior, maybe more, and it’s easy to tell. His hair is gray, his face is wrinkled, and he looks worn—tired.\n\nWill I look like that in a couple of decades?\n\nBeing an Alpha takes its toll.\n\nBeing an Alpha King is worse.\n\n“Thank you for seeing me, Alpha Maddox,” he begins, withdrawing his hand from his mouth. “I do appreciate you letting us stay here for a few nights. Traveling all the way through the kingdom is tiresome.”\n\n“Of course,” I say, folding my hands on my desk. He still hasn’t answered my question. I am a patient man until I am not.\n\nHe clears his throat. “I guess I should get straight to the point, then?” he says, that rumbling chuckle back.\n\nI wait, not needing to say that he most certainly should do just that.\n\n“A few of the Alphas have been speaking about the… conflict that is going on now. The problems we’ve been having.”\n\n“I know all about that,” I say, not wanting to get into it right now. “What have you been discussing?”\n\n“Well, only that… with the instability in the kingdom and the unrest, it would be best for the people if they had something to celebrate, something to… cheer them up and stay focused on that is more positive.”\n\nI continue to look at him, my forehead wrinkled. I am trying to figure out where he is going with this, but I don’t want to attempt to guess because if it is where I think it might be… I might leap over my desk and cause bodily harm to the man.\n\n“What are you getting at?” I finally ask him.\n\nHe shifts his weight in his chair. It creaks under the strain as if it also wants to protest whatever it is he’s about to say to me. “You need an heir.”\n\nIt is exactly what I thought he was going to say and exactly what he should have never let come out of his mouth.\n\nKeeping my face stoic, I glower at the man.\n\n“I have a beautiful daughter who is a few years younger than you. She has gone through her first few heats. She is ripe for breeding. She could give you an heir, Your Majesty. It would be good for the kingdom. Zabrina would make a wonderful Luna.” He takes a deep breath as if he is satisfied that he has gotten the message out.\n\nThe air settles around us, and I lean back in my chair, remembering what Seth always tells me about thinking before I react.\n\nThe man is introducing the idea of his daughter to me in similar language to the way Alpha Ernest mentioned the girl he brought me, though there was no talk of her heats. I suppose that’s only because he had no way of knowing.\n\nHe had told me the girl was a virgin, though.\n\nAlpha Jordan had not made any mention of that for his daughter…\n\nI shake my head. “Alpha Jordan, I thought I had made it clear that I didn’t intend to marry again. Your daughter deserves to find her mate and—”\n\n“She’s found him,” he says, interrupting me.\n\nWaiting, I stare at him, anticipating he’ll tell me more.\n\n“It was the son of a Beta from a neighboring kingdom. She met him at a ball. The mate bond was not strong, but it was there. She rejected him, and he left.” Alpha Jordan shrugs like this is of no consequence.\n\n“But everyone knows rejecting one’s mate has consequences,” I remind him.\n\n“I believe that the consequence was that our territory was attacked shortly thereafter, but we were victorious. Nothing else has happened. Zabrina is fine.”\n\n“And she’s had no physical pain from the rejection?” This goes against everything I’ve ever heard.\n\n“No, not that I’ve heard her complain of,” he says nonchalantly.\n\n“Strange.” I have to wonder if perhaps this man wasn’t actually her mate. Losing my mate has caused me nothing but torturous heartache.\n\nAnd the only way it will ever end is if the Moon Goddess grants me another mate…\n\n“Nevertheless, I don’t intend to take another Luna, Alpha Jordan,” I tell him dismissively.\n\n“But what about an heir?” he asks. “Our kingdom must have an heir, Alpha Maddox.”\n\n“I am aware,” I tell him, my tone sharp. “Why don’t you let me handle that for myself, Alpha Jordan?”\n\nHis face turns a bit pink as I put him in his place, but then, he feels it is necessary to tell me, “Of course, but… know that the other Alphas are discussing the situation. There’s… chatter.”\n\nI clear my throat and lean forward in my chair a bit, looking into his eyes. “I hope that those Alphas who are speaking against me understand that there will be consequences for traitorous behavior.”\n\nI see his eyes widen slightly. “Oh, yes, sir. No, nothing like that. We are all loyal to you, sir. Only… concerned. That’s all.”\n\nI nod, but I don’t trust him.\n\nI’m not sure I trust any of them.\n\n“Thank you, Alpha Jordan. I appreciate your concern, and I’m sure your daughter is a lovely person, but I am not looking for another Luna. Rebecca was my Luna, and that’s how it will remain.”\n\nHe adjusts his tie and cannot look at me as he says, “Yes, of course, Alpha Maddox. But if you change your mind—”\n\n“I won’t.” I stand, and he does as well. He offers his hand, and I shake it before showing him to the door.\n\nOnce he is gone, I get to the cabinet and pour myself a drink. Downing it, I refill my glass. I need to go get ready for dinner soon. I am so tired of hearing about how we need an heir, as if I don’t know that.\n\nThe whisky burns my tongue as it goes down. Maybe Alpha Ernest isn’t such a fool after all.",

        "content": "Isla\n\nI sit on the edge of the bed for a few minutes after Poppy leaves, contemplating what to do. She's turned the bathtub on, so I know I have to go into the bathroom eventually, or else the tub will overflow.\n\nI want to take a bath. It sounds luxurious. I can't remember the last time I did anything like that for myself. For the last few years, everything I've done has been for my family.\n\nBut… the idea of taking my clothes off and soaking in the tub in this amazing room seems frightening and foolish.\n\nAll of this has to be a mistake, and when they find out about it, shouldn't I at least be dressed?\n\nStill, if I take a quick bath, maybe I can be in and out before Poppy returns. If there's one thing I've learned about this castle, it's that it is huge.\n\nSetting my bag down on the chest at the end of the bed, I head into the bathroom and take my clothes off, hanging my wet, dirty clothes on a hook on the door, embarrassed by my old underwear and bra that doesn't really fit me correctly. I decide to leave the door open a crack so I can hear if Poppy comes back in.\n\nI turn the bathtub off and notice there are hair clips on the sink, so I grab a few. I want to wash my hair, but then I plan to clip it up out of the way so I can be sure to wash well.\n\nThe moment my feet touch the warm water, I feel a soothing sensation ripple through my body. I'm not sure what Poppy put in this water, but it feels amazing. I sink into it, and my whole body relaxes. Not only does it smell wonderful—like roses and lavender—but it wraps around my body like a warm blanket.\n\nI may never get out of this tub.\n\nRemembering I was going to try to hurry, I sink down and wash my hair; using the bottles of floral-smelling shampoos and conditioners on the side of the tub, I scrub my hair and my scalp before clipping my hair up out of the way and using the body wash and a soft sponge to wash myself off. Once I'm sure I'm clean from head to toe, I sink back into the water, telling myself I'm just going to soak for a minute, and then I'll get out.\n\nI must've dozed off because when I opened my eyes later, the water was a bit cooler, and I realized I'd been asleep.\n\nBut then I also realized that what had woken me was the sound of the door opening in my bedroom.\n\nI sit up quickly, remembering that I had that robe but not remembering exactly where it is. I see a pile of towels nearby.\n\n\"Poppy, is that you?\" I call, praying it is just the housekeeper coming back with the clothes she'd gone to find for me.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI get my answer when a deep, rumbling voice answers my question. I inhale sharply and hold it for a second. There is a man in my room—and I am naked.\n\nQuickly, I get out of the tub, drying off as best I can. At least my hair is dry. I am frantic, and clearly, I am not thinking straight. I wrap the towel around myself, thanking the Moon Goddess that it's so huge that it will wrap all the way around me and then some, and then walk out to see who he is.\n\nI stick my head out first, and he is just standing there, his hands on his hips, near my bed.\n\nHe is gorgeous. My breath catches in my throat, and I stand there, wide-eyed, glad he's not looking directly at me while I fight to get control of my racing heart.\n\nHe's tall, at least six foot four, with dark brown hair and eyes that glow like emeralds. His broad shoulders are ripped beneath the white button-down shirt he's wearing, and he looks to be nothing but lean muscle. Visions of what lies beneath his clothing come to mind, but I can't let them linger because I am aware that I am still naked.\n\nHis eyes land on me then, and they slightly widen as if he's just realized he's interrupting my bath. Since he is clearly someone important, I rush out, holding my towel tight.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" I say. \"Poppy is getting me something acceptable to wear, but if I'm in the wrong room…\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he says. \"You're not.\" He looks me up and down, but he doesn't let his eyes dawdle on the part of me that's covered with the towel like some men would do.\n\nI expect him to say more, but when he doesn't, I just stand there for a moment before I realize. \"I… have a robe.\"\n\nHe nods. \"Good.\"\n\nI assume that means I should get it, so I rush back into the bathroom and see where Poppy has placed it. I drop the towel and put the robe on, tying it tightly and running back out through the partially ajar door.\n\nWhen I'm back in the bedroom, I still don't know what to say to him, and he seems to be a man of few words.\n\n\"I wanted to see if you were all right,\" he finally says, his voice a low rumble that makes my body tingle.\n\n\"Oh, yes. I'm well, thank you,\" I say, wondering if perhaps he works for Beta Seth. Perhaps Beta Seth couldn't come.\n\nHe nods. \"I heard about Mrs. Worsthingshorethinshire striking you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I say, my hand going to my face. Is he here to investigate that incident? I withdraw my hand and clench the robe closed.\n\n\"She won't bother you again.\" His hands are shoved deep into his pockets, and he seems very sure of himself.\n\nI can't help but feel bad about the entire situation. \"Thank you,\" I say, but I still feel bad for her.\n\nHe picks up on that. \"Are you bothered by her being let go?\"\n\n\"Oh, uh… it's just… she was fired because of me.\" My eyes are glued to the ground near his expensive leather loafers.\n\n\"No,\" he corrects me. \"She was fired for striking a guest in the face. That's completely unacceptable.\"\n\nHe has a point. \"Yes, sir,\" I say. I lift my head a bit and look him in the face, and I can't help but notice his eyes are scrutinizing me now. I wish I knew what he was thinking. We are so far apart. I want to be closer to him. I want to breathe him in and wrap his scent around me. If I were closer, perhaps his hand might accidentally brush my skin…\n\n\"Well, I should go. I just wanted to check on you. If you need anything, I'm sure Poppy will get it for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I say. \"Thank you.\" I manage to smile at him, but I am not very confident, not that I doubt Poppy, but I still don't know why I am there.\n\nHe takes a step backward toward the door, but before he can turn to go, the door comes flying open, and Poppy bursts through. \"I'm back!\" she announces. \"And boy have I got some beautiful outfits for you! You're never going to—Oh! Your Majesty!\" Immediately, she drops the dresses on a chair by the door and bows low to the ground.\n\nConfusion washes over me as he shakes his head and turns to walk out. \"You can get up, Poppy,\" he says as she lifts her head.\n\n\"You know my name?\" Poppy asks.\n\n\"Yes, of course, I know your name, Poppy. Everyone knows your name.\" He opens the door to walk out.\n\nShe says, \"Thank you, Alpha King Maddox.\"\n\nAnd the world starts to go black as I feel like I'm going to pass out.",

        "content": "Maddox\n\nI need air.\n\nI need to think.\n\nI need to get away from… that woman.\n\nIt’s a good thing that Poppy came into the room when she did, or else… I’m not sure what might’ve happened, but it might’ve gotten heated very quickly.\n\nI walk down the hallway the short distance to my own rooms, dragging my hand down my face as I go. I know I shouldn’t have even stopped there on my way to my room to get ready for my dinner with the visiting Alpha, but curiosity got the better of me.\n\nThe urge to see her for myself overwhelmed me, so I made a stop.\n\nPart of me is very glad that I did, but the other part of me wishes that I had just let it be…\n\nI had no idea she was going to be in the bathtub when I walked in.\n\nThen, she’d scurried out, dripping wet, her pale skin glistening with water droplets, the scent of rosewater enticing me to step closer.\n\nHer hair, golden curls, pulled up on top of her head in the back, were damp and not secured all the way. Ringlets framed her beautiful face as she stood there, wide-eyed, her sapphire eyes staring at me, trying to determine what I was doing there.\n\nHer luscious lips, slightly parted, were so plump and perfect that I could imagine what they must taste like. I wanted to step across the room and take her bottom lip between my teeth. I could have lifted her tiny body up onto the bed, the towel sliding onto the floor as my hands wandered all over her body.\n\nShe had no idea that when she went into the bathroom to put on that robe, she’d left the door slightly ajar, and in the mirror, I’d seen her perfect backside reflected in the mirror, the curve of her breast, her erect nipple…\n\nI pulled the door open to my room, my erection straining against my pants, and headed straight for my shower, turning the water to cold. I knew I’d be thinking about the girl, Isla, all through dinner.\n\nIf the Alpha’s daughter, whatever the fuck her name was, threw herself at me again, I might have to take her up on the offer only to get rid of the enormous hard-on I’ve got growing in my pants just thinking about her.\n\nI’ve got to get her off my mind.\n\nUndressing, I jump into the shower and let the cold water wash away the stiffness in my groin. I try to think about the work I need to do, the conversations that need to be had with Alpha Jordan and others. If I think about work, maybe I won’t think about the girl.\n\nI should be used to not thinking about women I don’t want to think about.\n\nFlashes of Rebecca’s beautiful face flicker before my eyes, and I push them away as I have been doing for years.\n\nEver since that fateful night.\n\nSince then, I’ve been with lots of women, mostly to drown the pain of losing her, but none of them have meant a thing to me. I definitely haven’t had any issues with getting them off my mind.\n\nIsla’s bright blue eyes come to mind, and I have to wonder if she just might be different.\n\nI turn the water so that it’s a tad colder and stand beneath it a bit longer before I finally get out and get dressed for dinner.\n\nWhen I’m dressed in a suit with a jade green tie that’s nearly the color of my eyes, my hair is styled, and I’m ready to go, I take a moment to stand in front of the mirror and wonder why I even have these formal dinners.\n\n“Why can’t we just retire these dinners and make them a thing of the past?” I ask myself aloud. I hate them so much…\n\nBut visitors to the castle like them, so we continue to have them.\n\nAnd we, theoretically, get a lot of work done at them…\n\nA knock at the door alerts me that Seth is there to collect me. I grumble a bit before I say, “Yeah,” and he sticks his head in.\n\n“Ready?” he calls.\n\n“No,” I say.\n\nHe looks around my room. “Why don’t you ever turn on a lamp?” he asks.\n\nRather than answering the question, I reply, “Why don’t you ever mind your own business?” and walk to the door.\n\nWe head down the hall together, past Isla’s room, and I take a deep breath as we go.\n\nI smell rosewater, and my pants begin to tighten.\n\nIt seems I can’t do anything to escape the allure of the woman, no matter what I do. I will just have to keep my mind on something else.\n\nIn the dining room, most of the guests are waiting for us to arrive so that we can be seated. It is my duty to be the last to get there.\n\nBefore we take our seats, Alpha Jordan comes over, two women accompanying him.\n\n“Alpha Maddox, you remember my wife, Luna Elaine?”\n\n“Yes, of course.” I force a smile at the older brunette on his left arm. “Good evening,” I say to her.\n\n“Good evening, Your Majesty,” she says to me. “Thank you for inviting us.”\n\nI nod, and since Seth is standing right next to me, I manage to say, “Thank you for coming.”\n\n“And this is our daughter, Zabrina.” He turns and gestures to a young woman on his right.\n\nThe blonde who steps forward is tall and thin, with far too much makeup on. Her bright purple dress is very sparkly, and she has on large earrings that match. When she smiles and bats her eyelashes, I feel like I must be looking at the fakest, most spoiled Alpha’s daughter in all the land.\n\n“Hello,” I say as she offers me her hand, but not to shake… to kiss.\n\n“Hello, Your Majesty,” she says as I stare at the back of her fingers.\n\nI do not feel like pressing her hand to my lips, but an image of Isla’s mouth comes to mind. That… I’d like to press to my lips… I take Zabrina’s thin hand and twist it, giving it a good shake before I let it go. Her eyes widen as she is shocked at my behavior, but I am the king, and I’ll do as I wish.\n\n“Shall we be seated?” Seth says, stifling a laugh.\n\n“Yes, let’s do.” I walk to my seat, and everyone else does as well. I wait for everyone else, and we pull our chairs out and sit down.\n\nI am ready to get this dinner over with. Unfortunately, there will just be another one tomorrow.",

        "content": "Isla\n\n“Miss Isla? Miss Isla, are you all right?”\n\nThe sound of Poppy’s voice has my eyes flying open, and I realize I haven’t quite blacked out, but I have come close. I blink a few times and note she has her arms around me, and I have one arm on the bed. “I’m fine,” I tell her, blinking my eyes as I try to clear my head. “I’m fine.” I try to push myself up onto the mattress but find myself floundering, unable to get my limbs to cooperate.\n\n“Here, lie down for a moment. I’ll get you some water.” She begins to lift me up onto the bed, which is so tall, it’s nearly waist-high on me.\n\n“I can manage,” I assure her, and she lets me go. Somehow, I manage to climb up onto the bed, and Poppy heads into the bathroom, muttering under her breath that it’s taking far too long for them to bring my food.\n\nI sit there for a moment, staring at the door that King Maddox has just left through. My cheeks heat just thinking about him.\n\nThat was the king!\n\nI feel like such a fool. I should’ve known that it was the king I was speaking to, but then, I’ve never seen him before.\n\nHow was I supposed to know?\n\n“Here you go, sweetie,” she says, handing me the glass. I take it and sip it, but I’m still in shock. I barely get out a thanks. I hold the glass to my lips for a few minutes, willing the water to go down. “How long was he in here?” she asks me.\n\n“Not long,” I tell her. “Just a few moments.” I set the glass aside and force some deep breaths down my throat.\n\nI need to get a grip on this situation. Of course, I would meet the king eventually. I am just shocked that he was able to come in here and speak to me without me even realizing that it was him.\n\n“What were you talking about? Not that it’s my business.” Poppy gives me a small smile, and I feel like I need to tell her everything.\n\nBut I don’t know what to say so I just tell her, “Nothing. He just wanted to make sure that I was okay after that woman hit me.” I still couldn’t believe the king himself would come by to check on me—a lowly servant. I figure I would see him from afar, as obviously Poppy has at some point. But to have him in my chambers? Up close and personal? That seems impossible to believe.\n\n“That was awfully kind of him,” Poppy says. She goes back to the pile of clothing and begins to straighten it up. Some of it fell on the floor when she saw the king and dropped to her knees. Maybe I was supposed to do the same. Should I have immediately dropped to the floor? That would’ve been difficult in the little I am wearing. Did I even bow my head? I don’t even remember.\n\nA knock at the far door interrupts Poppy, and she goes out to it, leaving me alone with my thoughts for a moment. The king just saw me wearing only a towel with my hair up and a bare face. I’m sure he wouldn’t expect anything more of a servant, but still… it’s embarrassing. I can only imagine what he must be thinking of me. He probably thought I looked hideous. I’m sure I won’t ever see him again, not after that.\n\n“Here you go—finally!” Poppy says, setting down a plate with some dinner on it. I can’t see what it is, but it smells good. “Come and eat, sweetie, while I figure out what you should put on. I doubt you’ll have any more visitors tonight, but one never knows.”\n\nI am starving. I can’t remember the last time I ate a full meal, so even though I feel a bit odd eating in front of her, I get off the bed and go over to eat.\n\nIt’s chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy and a roll. To drink, there’s a small bottle of champagne.\n\n“This is for me?” I ask her. “Are you sure?”\n\n“I’m sure,” she says. “That’s what they’re having at dinner. They just fixed a plate for you.”\n\nI stare at her for a moment, flabbergasted. Servants at the castle eat really, really well. I sit down and begin to eat, trying to control myself. I didn’t even see the chocolate cake at first. I can’t believe all of this food is for me.\n\nPoppy finishes hanging up the clothes, and as she does so, she talks about King Maddox. “He’s so handsome. He has women from all over the kingdom throwing themselves at him all of the time, of course. And he doesn’t like it. You know, he’s sworn never to take another Luna.”\n\n“Yes, that’s what I’ve heard,” I say.\n\n“Luna Rebecca was the love of his life, his true mate. He loved her so much. Some people say they’ve never seen anyone so much in love with their mate. He’s even said that if the Moon Goddess gives him another mate, he will reject her. That’s what I’ve heard, anyway. It’s not like I converse much with him.”\n\nI don’t have much to say to that. He did say he knew who she was, after all. I only smile at her and keep eating, trying to remember to chew and not scarf it down.\n\n“But… he is lonely and sad, I think, and he’s too young for all that. I hope, one day, he meets a beautiful young woman who will make him forget all of his sadness.” She smiles at me with a twinkle in her eye, and I think she’s trying to imply something, but I don’t know what it might be.\n\nI am nearly finished eating now. I haven’t drank the champagne because I don’t really drink alcohol, and I’m so lightheaded from nearly fainting, it’s probably not a good idea. I take a few bites of my cake and say, “Well, I hope he finds someone. He seems like a nice man.”\n\nShe chuckles. “Yes, I hope you do.”\n\nI look up at her, not understanding what she means. The way she said that implies that I may have had an ulterior motive in what I said, and I most certainly do not. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean… it’s only natural that someone in your position would want him to find… someone to make him happy. I think you should put this on when you’re done.” She smiles and sets out a pajama set for me on the bed. I have no idea what time it is, but if the king is eating dinner, maybe it is time to get ready for bed. I think those dinners usually start late.\n\nI finish eating and take another sip of my water before I ask, “What do you mean, someone in my position?” I get up and walk over to the bed where she has laid the pajamas as she goes to the table to get the tray I’m finished with ready to set out for the other servants to pick up.\n\nThe pajamas are very nice. I have no idea what’s happening or why I am here, but I still think there’s been some sort of a mistake.\n\nPoppy gathers up the tray and opens the door as she says. “You know, someone in your position. Someone like you will obviously grow attached to him. I know I would.” She makes a face at me, wide-eyed, and smiles before she goes out.\n\nI am lost and wait for her to come back in. “Attached to him?” I ask as she reenters the room.\n\n“Of course. Or… is this not your first time doing this sort of thing? Forgive me. I didn’t know. I just assumed…”\n\n“What sort of thing?” I ask. She must know more about why I’m here than I do. Sitting up straighter on the bed, I ask, “Poppy, do you know why I’m here—what my job at the castle is?”\n\n“Why, of course I do,” she says with a shrug. “Everyone does!”\n\n“Everyone does?” I ask. Apparently, everyone does but me.\n\n“Yes, of course! It’s been the talk of the entire staff since your arrival. I have to say, there are quite a few women who are jealous of you! If I’m completely honest, I’m one of them.” She laughs and covers her mouth. “I hope that doesn’t offend you. I’m sure it’s not as easy a job as everyone thinks.”\n\nI am still quite confused, so I look her in the eye and finally ask “And what is that exactly? What job is it that I’ll be doing?” I ask her.\n\nShe scoffs and says, “You just want to hear me say it, dear? Fine! I don’t mind. Everyone knows it. You’re the Alpha king’s breeder. You’re going to have his baby.”",

        "content": "Isla\n\n“I’m… what?”\n\nI need to sit down. I find a way to sit on the bed, struggling to catch my breath, the pajamas I was getting ready to put on forgotten on the bed next to me since I’ve heard Poppy’s words. That’s what breeder means??\n\nPoppy is looking at me from across the bedroom, a puzzled expression on her face.\n\n“You… didn’t know?” she asks me. “How is it that you didn’t know? How did you get here?”\n\n“I…” I feel my face flush as I lean back against the pillows, trying to process everything.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nThat’s what Alpha Ernest sold me to Alpha Maddox to do?\n\nTo be his breeder?\n\n“I’m so sorry,” Poppy says, coming over and resting her hand on my leg. “I just assumed that you either had done this before or had taken it upon yourself to make this into your career. I had no idea you had no idea, dear. And don’t think that I was judging you because of it! I mean… who wouldn’t want to be a breeder for Alpha Maddox?” She smiles at me and waggles her eyebrows, and I know that she’s trying to make me laugh, but it’s not working.\n\nI want to bury my face in my hands and cry.\n\nI think of my poor mother back home and how hard she’s worked for all of her children, how my dad saved when I was little to be able to afford to bring us all to a new land to start over after political insurrection made us flee his homeland.\n\nHow I’ve spent so many hours slaving away at so many jobs over the last two years trying to erase this debt that just keeps mounting because of my brother… through absolutely no fault of his own, bless his soul.\n\nAnd this is where I end up.\n\nMy mom would be so disappointed in me. When my parents find out that this is what I’m doing, that this is what Alpha Ernest has traded me off to do… they will disown me.\n\nNo, they are too sweet for that, but they will be so disappointed in me that they will never be able to look me in the eye again.\n\nTears begin to stream down my face. I can’t help it. Poppy wraps her arm around me. “I am so sorry, sweetie. You know, Alpha King Maddox is scary on the outside, but I bet if you tell him your situation, that you didn’t know, I bet he will let you go. I’m sure, however, you got here, he’ll reverse it.”\n\nI think about her words for about five seconds and then shake my head. “I can’t do that,” I say, sitting up and wiping my eyes on the back of my hand. Poppy grabs a tissue for me from the nightstand. “Thank you.”\n\nI dry my face and try to get myself under control before I tell her, “My Alpha brought me here. My family owes him a lot of money. I went to him this morning to see if there was any work I could do to pay off our debt, and he brought me here. If I go back now, he will not be fulfilling his promise to Alpha Maddox, and I won’t be fulfilling my promise to him. So… my family will either still owe him money, or he’ll make me become some sort of sex slave to him.” The thought of servicing Alpha Ernest makes my blood run cold.\n\n“I take it that your Alpha is not as… fetching as the king?” Poppy asks, and I nearly throw up all of the food I just ate.\n\nI make a face and shake my head, and she laughs, which makes me laugh.\n\n“Well, of all of the jobs to have, honey, it could be worse. I mean… at least he looks like a god and not like your Alpha,” she says with a shrug.”\n\nI want to think that that’s true, and it is, but still… the idea of Alpha Maddox on top of me, of my naked body underneath his as he enters me... No, I can’t let my mind go there. I spit out, “I’m a virgin.”\n\n“Oh,” she says, her eyes wide. She opens her mouth, closes it, and then says, “Oh,” again. “I guess… that’s why you’re worth so much, perhaps?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I tell her. “My mother told me a bit. I have a lot of brothers and sisters, so I know how it all works. But… that doesn’t mean I’m comfortable with it.”\n\n“How old are you, sweetie?” Poppy asks.\n\n“Twenty,” I tell her. “Just barely. My birthday was a few weeks ago.”\n\nShe smiles. “I’m twenty-three, and I’ve been with two different men. Neither of them was my mate. I haven’t found him yet. It’s okay, though. It can be fun. Well, it depends on the man. Anyway, I’m sure, with the king… it’ll be pretty amazing.”\n\nI can only stare at her. “But… what about having a baby? And giving birth? And then what? I suppose he’ll hire a nanny or something, and I’ll leave here. I’ll go back to my pack, and I’ll never see my baby again?”\n\nPoppy sits down near my feet and lets out a sigh. “Yes, I do think that’s how it normally works. I don’t have a lot of experience with breeders, but I do know of another maid who used to work at Alpha Samuel’s estate in his pack lands, and he had a few breeders. Each one had a child, and every time, he’d send them away.” She looks at me, a sad expression in her eyes. “Maybe knowing it ahead of time will help you to keep from getting too attached.”\n\n“Maybe,” I say, but I doubt it. I don’t think I can carry a baby for nine months and not love it completely.\n\nBut then… I don’t think I can make love to a man and not love him, either.\n\n“Why doesn’t he just find another Luna?” I ask. “I know what you said about him loving his first wife and mate so much that he swears he’ll never have another wife, but I can’t imagine what could’ve possibly happened to Luna Rebecca that has made him decide he’d never fall in love again.”\n\nPoppy makes a face, and I’m not sure what it means. “No one knows for sure what happened to her,” she says, her voice a whisper.\n\nI look around. No one is here, so I don’t know why she is whispering. I shrug. “Well, it couldn’t be so awful that he thinks he should be forced to live the rest of his life alone. If he is a good man, as you say, then he shouldn’t have a breeder. He should find a worthy woman, an Alpha’s daughter, and marry again. He deserves a second chance at happiness.”\n\nPoppy shrugs. “Perhaps, but not if the rumors are true…”\n\n“Rumors?” I ask. “What rumors?”\n\n“About what happened to Luna Rebecca,” she says, still whispering.\n\nI am getting tired of playing guessing games. “And what, exactly, is that?” I ask her.\n\nPoppy clears her throat and says, “That he killed her.”",

        "content": "Maddox\n\n“This ham is delightful. I absolutely love the flavor. Did your chef prepare it especially for me, Alpha?”\n\nThe sound of the insipid girl seated across from me blathering on about ham is making me want to tear off all of my clothes and shift right here on the table. I want to let my wolf run free, to grunt and growl and howl at the moon, and if my sharp claws and long fangs should happen to make contact with her pasty white skin and make a tear or two, well, sometimes these things cannot be helped…\n\n“Alpha King Maddox?” she repeats as if I’m not answering her because I somehow managed not to hear her. “Did your chef make this lovely ham with me in mind?”\n\n“Yes,” I say. “Yes, he did. He somehow knew that you would love it, even though he’d never met you before.”\n\nSeth’s foot taps mine beneath the table. It is the closest thing to a warning my Beta will give me since I am the king, after all. It isn’t as if he feels he can get away with mashing his heel into my toes or something of that nature.\n\nZabrina thinks I am being silly, I guess, because she giggles behind her hand. “He is a wonderful guesser then because it’s just divine.”\n\nI say nothing in response, and she takes a drink of her wine, draining it. Her glass isn’t empty for more than two seconds before her entire disposition changes, and she angrily snaps her finger at the servant standing behind her, a woman she’s brought with her for the express purpose of waiting on her, and the woman springs into action to pour her more.\n\n“That’s more like it, Maud,” she says, her tone showing her irritation. “The ham might be flavorful, but that doesn’t mean I won’t get thirsty.”\n\nThe servant girl says nothing, only falls back into her place near the wall. I can’t help but look at her, standing there, her eyes downcast. She can’t be more than fourteen, maybe fifteen. She looks terrified, and I have to wonder if Zabrina is the type of woman who would strike her servant if she didn’t do what she wanted.\n\nI believe she is.\n\nThe servant isn’t the only woman Zabrina has brought with her. She has also brought along three friends. She calls them her ladies, and they are just as annoying as she is. I have no idea what their names are. She introduced them earlier, but I wasn’t paying attention. All I know is, between the four of them, I’m bound to be irritated to no end if Alpha Jordan intends to stay in the castle for more than a night or two.\n\nHe has only asked to stay here on his way through the area on business, but now that I know his true intention, I have a feeling he will have some sort of calamity befall him.\n\nSomething will be wrong with one of his vehicles. One of his drivers will fall ill. He will suddenly lose all sense of direction and have no idea where he is going…\n\nHe will be forced to stay in the castle until I say I will marry his daughter.\n\nHe will be forced to stay here until the day after, never then, because that simply will not happen.\n\nThough it’s obvious that the other Alphas are growing weary of my excuse, that I simply will not marry again after what happened with Rebecca, it will have to appease them because it’s the truth.\n\nI will not take another bride.\n\nIf I am to have an heir… it will have to come another way.\n\nMy mind returns to the girl.\n\nThe soft round mound of her breast. Her erect nipple. The way her bottom moved as she reached for her robe.\n\nI let my mind get away from me for a moment and imagine myself following her into the bathroom, coming up behind her to cup her breasts. She leans back into me as my mouth comes down on her neck. She moans my name softly as my teeth nip at the tender flesh of her shoulder, my tongue tracing up to her ear.\n\nMy hands caress her full breasts, my thumbs working her nipples, plucking and pulling as her groans get louder, her arousal stronger. I smell it in the air around us. Her open mouth against my cheek as she hunts for my mouth, longing to taste me, moans with desperation.\n\nI slide a hand down her flat belly, pressing her against my erection as I spread her legs and slip a finger between her dripping wet thighs. She’s already in spasm when my finger enters her. I feel her muscles tense around me as her arm comes up to loop around my neck. She begs me to take her, to bend her over right there and press my cock inside of her so deep that I stretch her completely and fill her fuller than she’s ever been before—\n\n“Alpha?”\n\nSeth’s voice has me blinking, and I realize I’ve completely lost track of the conversation around me. My dick is so hard beneath the table, it may as well have five legs. I won’t be getting up anytime soon. “Yes?” I ask.\n\n“Are you all right, sir?” he asks me.\n\n“I’m sorry. I have a lot on my mind,” I tell him. “With… the situation with the… attacks.”\n\nSeth arches an eyebrow, and I know he doesn’t believe me, but Alpha Jordan says, “It is an abysmal situation that is certain. You know, I heard twenty-five civilians were killed last week alone?” He launches into a discussion of what he has heard about attacks in his own territory.\n\nI want to ask him if he thinks that it has anything to do with his daughter rejecting her mate, but I don’t bother.\n\nWe’ve already had that discussion today, and it fell on deaf ears.\n\nIt doesn’t take too long before the talk of war had deflated my erection, and I decide it is time to leave the table before it returns. If my mind returns to the girl again before I can make it back to my room, I might be there all night.\n\n“Well, I say,” setting my napkin aside, “I will take my leave.”\n\n“But…” Zabrina says, a wide-eyed, disappointed look on her face, “I thought we might go for a walk in the garden, Your Majesty.”\n\n“Not tonight,” I tell her. Not any night, I want to add but don’t. “The rest of you are free to stay and enjoy the musicians in the great hall, but I have had a long day and will be retiring for the evening. Beta Seth will be happy to entertain you.”\n\nSeth is never happy to do so, but he knows it is part of his duties. “Yes, of course,” he says. “Let’s finish our dessert first, shall we?”\n\nI haven’t even made it through the final course, but I don’t care. I’m the king, and I shall do as I please.\n\nMy shoes echo down the hall as I head toward my room. Most of the lights are off now, and the pieces of artwork cast strange shadows. It’s times like this when I sometimes wonder, if Rebecca is still here, might I see a glimpse of her?\n\nBut I never do…\n\nI reach the girl’s door first, and even though I intend to keep walking, I find myself stopping outside of the door. I wonder if she is still awake. I wonder if she is lying there, thinking about what her duties are supposed to be now that she is here. Is she frightened? Is she excited?\n\nHas she thought at all about me the way I’ve been thinking about her?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would think, of course, she has. I am the Alpha King. Any woman would be lucky to have the opportunity to be bedded by me.\n\nBut there’s something different about Isla. Something unique.\n\nI lift my hand and rest it on the door, wanting to go in. I just want to see her, or so I tell myself.\n\nBut it’s too soon.\n\nShe is young and vulnerable, and I don’t want to scare her.\n\nEveryone says I am ruthless and terrifying.\n\nPerhaps that is true, but I don’t need to be that way to her.\n\nNot yet, anyway.\n\nI make myself keep walking. I may ravish her—but tonight, it will have to be in my dreams.",

        "content": "Isla\n\nI lay awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, pondering what it is that Poppy has told me about the Alpha King. It’s hard to believe it could possibly be true.\n\nYet, how can I doubt it?\n\nBack home, I never knew much about him. I had too much to worry about to ever spend much time thinking about the Alpha King. Whenever anyone mentioned King Maddox, it was always in one of two contexts—how unbelievably good-looking he was.\n\nOr how unbelievably cruel he was.\n\nNow… Poppy has revealed to me that everyone in the castle believes he is responsible for the death of his mate, Luna Rebecca, the woman everyone says is the sweetest, kindest, gentlest soul any of them has ever met.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nI don’t know, but as I lay here on my back, staring at the ceiling, I have to wonder… will a similar fate befall me?\n\nI’m to be his breeder.\n\nWhat will that entail exactly?\n\nA shudder begins at the top of my neck and travels down my spine. I know the gist of it. I understand that it will be my job to lay with the king, to spread my legs for him, to pleasure him.\n\nHe is an attractive man, and I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t find myself experiencing sensations I never had before when he was in my room.\n\nEven though I had no idea who he was, just being in his presence made my muscles clench in ways they never had before.\n\nI felt a tightening in my core that I never had until that moment.\n\nMy hand slides down between my legs just thinking of it now, and I’m glad I’m alone, lying in this massive bed with these plush, comfortable blankets. I press my fingers against the outside of my most sensitive area, hoping that doing so will make the ache I’m feeling go away.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to help. Just thinking about the king makes my flesh bead up with a sheen of sweat. I need to push the blankets down away from my face so I can breathe.\n\nI wonder what it would feel like if it was his hand on me and if these pajamas were not in the way.\n\nThis certainly isn’t making the ache go away…\n\n“Knock it off, Isla,” I whisper to myself. “You’re just making it worse.”\n\nI try rolling over and remind myself that I’m in a strange place, away from my family, and I have no idea when I might see them again.\n\nThat’s enough to make the ache dissipate. I miss my parents and my brothers so much. How I wish that I could’ve stayed at home and paid off my parents’ debt from there.\n\nAlpha Ernest should’ve been more straightforward with me.\n\nBut now, the damage was done, and here I am.\n\nI hope that Alpha Maddox will allow me to go home for a visit soon. I imagine my mother’s face. I hope she’s not crying. I miss her so much, and I know she has to miss me, too.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I close my eyes and try to go to sleep. Otherwise, I might start to cry.\n\nSince it’s been such a long day, I am exhausted, and I am just about to doze off when I get the sensation that someone is standing outside my door. Not the one right across the room from me, but the other one, the outer door.\n\nIt’s so far away from me, I really shouldn’t be able to tell, but I get the idea that someone is there just the same.\n\nAnd I know who it is.\n\nI hold my breath, not moving at all, as I wonder what might happen if he enters the room.\n\nIt’s too soon, isn’t it? This is my first night here. Surely, he won’t come in and want me to have sex with him on my very first night in the castle, will he?\n\nWon’t he at least give me one night to get settled?\n\nIt’s not as if I’m so beautiful that just catching one glimpse of me earlier will leave him so intrigued he won’t be able to forget about me.\n\nHe’s the king! He can have any woman he wants. Is he in that big of a hurry to make an heir?\n\nAfter a moment, I get the feeling that he has moved on, and I allow myself to breathe again.\n\nA wave of relief washes over me, and I thank the Moon Goddess that I won’t be called upon to service the king tonight.\n\n“What a relief,” I whisper. “I’m so glad that didn’t happen.”\n\nAt least, that’s what I’m trying to convince myself.\n\nThe ache is back between my legs, and something tells me that when I fall asleep tonight, I won’t be dreaming about my family.\n\nI’ll be dreaming of the Alpha King—and he’ll be on top of me.",

        "content": "Maddox\n\nI wake up the next morning with a hard cock and the memory of a very vivid dream about Isla.\n\nThis girl is affecting me in ways I never would’ve thought imaginable, and I don’t know why. It isn’t as if I’ve never seen an attractive woman’s naked ass before.\n\nStill, I have to take another cold shower before I can go to the office, and my hand is already sticky from my dirty thoughts of her the night before when I couldn’t fall asleep.\n\nAs I pass her room on my way to the office, I hear someone moving around behind the door and imagine it must be her.\n\nThe urge to burst in and go to her floods my mind. She belongs to me, after all. I can take her anytime I want to.\n\nI could never force a woman to do anything against her will, though. I might be brutal on the battlefield, but not in the bedroom.\n\nWell, not like that, anyway.\n\nI keep my feet moving. Temptation is high, but I will persevere.\n\nIn the office, I start working and manage to get through several reports before Seth knocks on my door. I sigh and tell him to come in, knowing it’s him because of the way he knocks. It’s always the same every morning.\n\nHe walks in looking like hell, and I have to wonder how long he stayed up entertaining our guests. “Good morning,” he says because it’s expected, not because he means it.\n\n“Seth,” I say, trying not to laugh. “What the hell happened to you?”\n\nHe shakes his head. “Zabrina happened to me, Alpha. That woman doesn’t know how to… shut up.”\n\nA chuckle erupts from my mouth. “I’m sorry,” I tell him. But I’m not really.\n\nHe shakes his head and sits down across from me to give me an update. “We’ve heard that there are more attacks happening along the borders of Duster pack and Pine Tree pack. Alpha Hayes seems to think he can infiltrate Alpha Bhamers territory and just take it.”\n\nI stare at him for a moment. Alpha Hayes of Duster pack is one of the bigger threats to the peace of our kingdom. I don’t like it when one Alpha attacks another, but in this case, I know why he’s doing it. Alpha Hayes wants to prove he’s capable of being the greatest leader in the kingdom.\n\nGreater than me.\n\nHe’s not the only Alpha who has this affliction, but he’s one of the more serious ones. And it doesn’t hurt that he has five strapping sons, so if he were to become king, there’d be no question that the bloodline would continue.\n\nI am meant to have a child by now… If I don’t have one soon, the Alphas will be able to rebel against me and see it as justified.\n\nThirty is the cut-off, and I’m almost there…\n\n“Anything else?” I ask Seth as if his announcement isn’t surprising or troubling to me.\n\nHe raises his eyebrows. “No, that’s all. Except Alpha Jordan spent a great deal of time last night trying to get me to speak to you on behalf of his daughter.”\n\nI roll my eyes. “I’m not interested in Zabrina.”\n\n“I know you’re not,” he says. “But… if you’re not planning on using the girl you purchased—”\n\n“I didn’t purchase her,” I correct him, feeling anger begin to bubble up inside of me. “I merely accepted her in exchange for a debt.”\n\n“Isn’t that the same thing?” he asks.\n\nNarrowing my eyes, I tell him, “No, it’s not.”\n\nHe shrugs. “Anyway… you know you only have ten months left before you turn thirty.”\n\n“I am aware of when my birthday is, Seth.”\n\n“So, you need to do something, Alpha. Or else, we’ll have even more problems on our hands.”\n\nHe’s right, but I don’t want to talk about it. “Go down to the military barracks and tell Commander Taylor to send a detail to Duster. I want to keep an eye on that situation and make sure that it doesn’t escalate out of control.”\n\nHe seems surprised at my dismissal of his comments without a remark. “Yes, sir,” he says. “But Zabrina wants you to have dinner with her again tonight… alone.”\n\n“And Zabrina can want whatever she’d like,” I tell him.\n\n“You may as well give her a try. If you don’t, he’ll just keep asking and complaining. Why don’t you have dinner with her, and if you don’t like her, you can tell Alpha Jordan it wasn’t a match?”\n\nThe thought of having to sit through a dinner date with Zabrina makes bile rise up in the back of my throat.\n\nBut, as usual, Seth has a point. “Fine,” I tell him, shaking my head. “Arrange it. But you’d better think of a way to get me out of there quickly.”\n\nI can tell he’s fighting a smile. “Yes, sir,” he says, getting up to leave the room.\n\nI watch him go and then swear under my breath. This is the last thing in the world I want to do.\n\nHaving a baby with Isla would make things much easier, but I don’t even know why she’s here. I could go speak to her, but that would be dangerous.\n\nI return my attention to my work, hoping to lose myself in what needs to be done. But my mind keeps flickering back to her. The soft curve of her breast, the tight muscles of her bottom…\n\nI’m in trouble.",

        "content": "Isla\n\n“Good morning, dear,” Poppy says, pulling the curtains in front of the window open. I squint at the bright light and try to wake myself up. It took me forever to fall asleep last night, and now that I am awake, I feel like I’ve been hit by a bus. My head is throbbing, and all I can think about is the dirty dreams I had about the king last night.\n\nI mutter, “Good morning,” and manage to get my eyes to open as I sit up.\n\n“Your breakfast is on the way. Would you like to take a shower while we are waiting? I will get your outfit ready for the day. I’m not sure what the king’s plans are, but we have permission to go outside. I can show you the gardens.” Poppy smiles at me in an encouraging manner, and I find myself growing a little excited to get outside of this room.\n\n“I think that would be lovely,” I tell her.\n\n“Good,” she says. “I’ll go warm the shower.”\n\nBefore I can protest, she is off and in the other room, turning on the water. I can manage. I’ve never had anyone do anything like this for me before, and I’m not sure what to think about it now.\n\nBut I can’t stop her from doing her job. We all have a job around here, apparently. I would love to change jobs with her. She has already told me that she would like to be the king’s breeder.\n\nI certainly don’t want this job.\n\nBut it’s mine, and there’s nothing I can do about it now.\n\nI make my way into the bathroom, and as Poppy hums a song out in the bedroom, I go about taking a shower, making sure to wash better than I ever have before. I also inspect my body for any unsightly hair. I have no idea exactly what the king might expect of me, but I don’t want to be embarrassed if he should see me naked.\n\nThe idea of the king seeing me naked has my face flushing. I wonder if I will get a chance to tell him I’ve never been with a man before or if he will even care. Perhaps he won’t treat me any differently than he has any of the other women he’s been with, and he will hurt me in the process.\n\nI try not to worry about it. I suppose that it’s just part of the job, and nothing he does to me will last forever.\n\nWhen I’m done with my shower, I get out and dry off, getting as much water out of my hair as possible. I stare at myself in the mirror. There are all kinds of cosmetics and lotions, perfumes, and powders on the dresser. I don’t usually wear much makeup, and I’m not even sure that I’m skilled enough to put it on, but I feel like I need to do something. I can’t let the king see me with nothing on my face again.\n\n“Are you all right?” Poppy shouts through the closed door to me.\n\n“Yes,” I tell her. “I am just trying to decide how to do my makeup.”\n\n“Can I come in?” she asks me.\n\n“Of course,” I tell her.\n\nShe comes in and says, “I can help with that if you want.”\n\nMy ears perk up. “Really?” I ask her. “I’m not very good at it.”\n\n“Sure!” she says, coming over to me. “No problem.” She directs me to sit down on a stool, and then she starts working on my face, talking as she goes. “With your coloring, you should wear brown eye shadow. It’ll make your blue eyes pop. And red lipstick will look lovely with your coloring, especially with your light hair.” I sit still and let her do her thing, and when I look at myself in the mirror, I can hardly believe I’m looking at myself.\n\n“Wow…” I mumble.\n\nShe laughs. “Pretty good, huh? Of course, you’re already beautiful. I just made your eyes pop.”\n\n“Thank you so much, Poppy!” I tell her. I think about hugging her, but I don’t know her that well yet.\n\n“No problem!” she declares. “Now, let’s get you dressed.”\n\nShe’s laid out a blue dress for me, and while I don’t need her help putting my clothes on, when she volunteers to style my hair and pick out my shoes and jewelry, I let her. When she’s done, I hardly recognize myself.\n\nHalf of my hair is pulled up on top of my head in a silver clip that matches my earrings, necklace, and bangle bracelets. The rest is falling down my back in loose curls. My shoes are silver sandals that match the rest of my accessories perfectly.\n\nI am beginning to feel like a princess!\n\nBut then, I remember, I’m just the Alpha King’s breeder. Not his romantic interest. No matter how beautiful I may look or feel, I am still just little ol’ Isla Moon from Willow pack. No one important…\n\n“Let’s go outside and get some fresh air,” Poppy suggests. I nod and force myself out of the stupor I’ve fallen into.\n\nWe walk down the winding halls, me following behind Poppy because I have no idea where we are going, and eventually, we make it to a door that leads outside. I’m glad I didn’t bump into anything along the way this time. Not that Poppy would hit me.\n\nGuards stand at the door, but they don’t blink as we approach, and Poppy pulls the barrier open. We step outside into fresh air and sunshine.\n\nImmediately, I feel better. I’m so glad that the rain from the day before has passed.\n\n“The garden is this way,” she tells me, and I follow along behind her as we make our way over to a huge section of velvety green grass with little walking trails that are lined by thousands and thousands of flowers of every color and variety. The scent is magnificent, and I can’t help but stop to smell each kind, from red roses to orange marigolds.\n\nWe walk along, taking in the beautiful scenery and smelling the flowers, chatting about how lovely everything is, including the fountains and statues we find around every bend. I can’t help but smile. It’s such a beautiful day with birds chirping in the trees and hardly a cloud in the sky.\n\nAnd then… we realize we are not alone.\n\n“Who are you?” a female voice snarls at me from behind a large oleander bush.\n\nI arch an eyebrow at her, not sure who she may be either, but it seems clear she’s someone important. She is dressed in a long red gown, her light hair pulled up on top of her head. A thousand jewels adorn her neck and ears. Her arms tinkle when they move, she’s wearing so many bracelets.\n\nOn either side of her stand two beautiful dark-haired women with the same evil glare in their eyes as the three of them take measure of me and Poppy.\n\n“I… I’m no one,” I stammer, looking down at the ground. I don’t want to offend her since clearly she is a guest of the king or lives here.\n\n“You must be someone,” she says, her hand on her hip as she steps around the bush. “Only a few important people have access to the king’s garden.”\n\n“I… I…”\n\n“She’s Isla,” Poppy says. “She’s a very important guest of the king.”\n\n“Are you speaking to me, servant girl?” the woman barks back. “I don’t need to hear an explanation from the likes of you!”\n\nI don’t know who this woman is, but I don’t appreciate the way she’s speaking to Poppy. “She’s simply answering your question,” I say, finally meeting her gaze. “I am Isla. And I am a guest of the king. That’s really all there is to it.”\n\n“A guest? From where?” she asks me. “Are you an Alpha’s daughter?”\n\nI almost laugh. “No,” I tell her. “I’m not. I’m from Willow pack. I arrived yesterday. May I ask who you are?”\n\n“No, you may not!” she says, taking a few hasty steps toward me until she’s right in front of me, nearly toe to toe. Her two friends come along. “Just know that I am the most special guest of the king of all of his guests, and one day, you will be calling me Luna!” With that, she tugs on her skirt and flips around, the dress flying up like a cape. The other two women glare at me for a moment before they all three turn and leave.\n\nI stand there staring after her for a long moment, wondering who in the world she was and what she meant about becoming the Luna.\n\nIs Alpha King Maddox engaged?\n\n“What a bitch!” Poppy exclaims. “I hate that woman already!”\n\nI can’t say the same because I don’t know her at all, and while she wasn’t nice to me, I don’t usually just people so quickly. “Who is she? Do you know?” I ask.\n\n“I do,” Poppy says, folding her arms and narrowing her gaze in the direction the three women left. “That was Zabrina from Elm pack,” she tells me. “Her father is Alpha Jordan. They also arrived yesterday. They’re allegedly here for some meetings with the king about the threats of war, but it seems to me that perhaps Alpha Jordan has something else in mind.”\n\nI shake my head. I can’t bear to think about Alpha Maddox marrying someone like Zabrina. I may not be head over heels in love with the idea of being his breeder, but I can’t allow myself to think about him being with that woman, either.\n\nOr any other woman, for that matter.\n\nAfter the dreams I had about him the night before, the thought of him so much as kissing another woman makes my heart drop to my stomach.\n\n“Well,” Poppy says, “I guess she’s in for a rude awakening.”\n\n“Why is that?” I ask. “She’s beautiful. Maybe he’ll fall in love with her.”\n\nPoppy scoffs. “Nope. It won’t happen. King Maddox will never marry her, no matter how beautiful she is.”\n\n“How do you know?” I ask, finally turning to look at my companion.\n\n“Simple,” she says with a shrug. “After Luna Rebecca died, he said he’d never marry anyone again. So that means he can’t marry her.”\n\nI stare at her for a moment before I nod and look away.\n\nI’m glad that he won’t be marrying Zabrina. But I can’t help but think, if he’s never going to marry anyone again, that also means he won’t be marrying me.\n\nWhile it is a farfetched dream for me to even consider Alpha King Maddox might fall in love with the likes of me, it was a dream I had considered.\n\nUntil that moment.\n\nNow, I knew for sure that all I would ever be was his breeder.\n\nAnd nothing more.",

        "content": "Maddox\n\nSitting across the small table on the balcony near the dining room from Zabrina, I try to be polite, but it’s difficult. She will not stop talking, and I couldn’t care less about what she has to say.\n\n“So then, I told Daddy that I really wanted the shoes in silver and gold. Because you never know what color will look best, you know?”\n\nI nod. No, I don’t know. And I don’t care. I really, really don’t give a flying fuck.\n\n“So he bought them, even though they cost ten thousand dollars for each pair. But then… it’s just money.” She giggles and takes a drink of her champagne. “You know what I mean, of course?”\n\nI smile. I do know what she means, but then, I also try not to waste money. I have an entire kingdom to think of, not just myself.\n\nPicking up my knife, I slice through my steak, watching the pink juice spill all over my plate. For a moment, I contemplate what it would look like to run the knife across her jugular, watching a different kind of juice, a dark crimson juice, pour out.\n\nI set the knife aside and remind myself I’m not on a battlefield. Sometimes, when you’ve seen everything I have, it’s difficult to remember….\n\nMy mind flickers to Rebecca, and I have to push the memory away. She certainly knew the secret darkness that haunted me since I returned from the war in the east….\n\n“You should drink some more of your champagne,” Zabrina says, her eyes on my half-finished glass. “You know, it’s a special bottle I brought with me from our pack lands. You’ll love it.”\n\nI smile at her and raise my glass to my lips. I usually like champagne, and she’s right to say that her pack is known for their wonderful champagnes and wines. But something about this particular glass tastes off. I can’t quite put my finger on it. When her lady-in-waiting brought it to me, I was anxious to taste it and finished my wine to have a sip, but now… I wish I hadn’t. It’s bitter, and I don’t know why….\n\nBut I don’t want to be rude, so I take another drink. Maybe I should just finish it off so I can have some more wine. But knowing Zabrina, she’ll insist on a refill.\n\nI set my glass down, nearly empty, and Zabrina’s eyes twinkle. “Do you like it?”\n\n“Sure,” I tell her, and she looks pleased.\n\nEventually, the staff brings out dessert, and I am overjoyed to know that this is the last course. As soon as it is finished, I will dismiss myself and get out of here. I’ve done my duty as a host.\n\n“So…” Zabrina says, “I was thinking, after dinner, we could go for a stroll in the garden.”\n\n“The garden?” I repeat. “Tonight?”\n\n“Yes, I was there earlier today, and it’s so beautiful. I’d love to have you join me for a moonlit stroll.”\n\nIn my mind’s eye, I see Isla’s face. If she was the one asking, I’d be tempted to take her up on the offer. I imagine her smiling face as she looks up at me, the silvery moon playing off her golden curls. I feel a twitch in my pants just imagining it.\n\n“Not tonight,” I tell Zabrina. Suddenly, all I can think about is Isla. Did she have a good day? Is she beginning to relax now that she’s been here a night and day? Or is she still terrified? I could tell when I met her the day before she was frightened. She shouldn’t be. I will take very good care of her….\n\n“You really should finish your champagne,” Zabrina says, slicing into her pie.\n\nReluctantly, I lift the glass and finish off the drink. Setting it down, I am tempted to sarcastically ask her if she’s satisfied. I don’t, though. I only smile at her.\n\nShe smiles back, and I swear I see something wicked in her grin.\n\nI take another bite of my chocolate cake, but I hardly taste it. My mind is still on Isla. I imagine she is lying in her bed now, naked, touching herself… running her hands along those curves, up the side of her breasts, along her round bottom, to her wet, aching core. She plunges three fingers in and cries out, whispering my name.\n\nUnder the table, my dick springs to life. I feel like a man about to peel his skin off.\n\n“Are you all right?” Zabrina asks, still smiling at me.\n\n“Actually, no,” I tell her, setting my napkin on the table. “I’m not feeling well. I’m afraid you’ll have to excuse me.”\n\nHer face falls. “What? But… our stroll….”\n\n“Not tonight,” I tell her. “I’m sorry, Zabrina, I truly am, but I must go.”\n\n“But—”\n\nI don’t wait to listen to her protest anymore. I have never felt this way before in my entire life. Though I’ve certainly been turned on before, the urgency I feel inside of me is all-encompassing. I fly up from the table and shoot out the door and down the hall as fast as my three legs can carry me.\n\nAs I speed down the hall toward Isla’s room, I am reminded that occasionally Rebecca would get me in such a frenzy, I’d have trouble controlling myself in public. She was so beautiful, such a graceful dancer, and her intoxicating floral perfume would drive me mad. I’d want to take her into a hallway bathroom and ravage her on the sink during a dinner party. I never did.\n\nEven in all of those times with my wife that I had trouble controlling myself, never once did I feel the earnestness I feel right now. My cock is so hard, I feel like my suit pants are about to be torn to shreds much like they are when we don’t strip before we shift.\n\nI am almost to her door now, and I can’t contain myself. I know that I’m liable to scare her, and with my heart pounding in my chest and my dick ready to spring out of my pants, I’ll likely hurt her if I can’t find a way to control myself, but in my mind, she’s lying in there, spread wide open, waiting for me, her hand stroking her pulsing pussy.\n\nNo, I need her. I need her now.\n\nI won’t be able to control myself.\n\nThe door is no barrier to me, even if it’s locked, and I don’t even bother to knock.",

        "content": "POV Megan:\n\nI woke up to the beautiful singing of the birds and the light coming through my window... No, it’s a lie; I was woken up by the damn diabolical device that calls itself my alarm; I touch with my fingers the night table next to the bed, with my eyes closed, looking for the damn demon, I stretch a little more, and I think I almost reached it, just a little more...\n\nSuddenly, I fell face” first to the ground with my face smashed into the wood.\n\nShit.\n\nThis must be my day, I think wryly.\n\nNot far away, I hear the laughter of my older brother, Nix.\n\nGreat, just great.\n\n“Stop kissing the floor and get up, there’s a family meeting in the living room in five minutes,” he said trying not to laugh again.\n\n“Leave me alone and let me sleep!” I shouted before I lay back down on my bed. I heard footsteps walking away, and sighing happily, I returned to Morpheus’ arms.\n\nA second later, I jumped out of my bed; I was all soaked in freezing water, fucking Nix was holding a bucket of water while clutching his stomach and laughing.\n\nYou son of a bitch, I’m gonna get you for this!\n\n“That’s for you to stop slacking,” he said. “Now get up, Daddy’s waiting, and it’s already noon.”\n\nI grabbed as fast as I could the baseball bat that I always kept next to my pillow, since you never know when you need to have a weapon at hand, I grabbed it with both hands and prepared for the race.\n\n“I’m going to send your head to the fucking stadium for this,” I shouted and walked out.\n\nRunning after him, when I had his placid ass in my sights, I batted and smiled when I heard him howl. “And this is just the beginning, little brother; you will pay for waking me up from my beauty sleep,” I said and laughed like crazy when my bat curled his head.\n\nI’m angry. How dare you? He’s going to pay for what he just did.\n\nThis is war, brother, I thought.\n\n“Helpaaaaaa!” shouted Nix. “Dad, Megan wants to kill me!”\n\nAnd this is supposed to be the future alpha, please?\n\nWe got to the living room, and there was my father, his name is Jerome Black and he is the alpha of the Black Moon pack. I quickly threw the bat to God knows where, I slowed down trying to control my breathing.\n\nGod, I hate running.\n\nWell, I hated anything that involved moving any part of my body; I closed my eyes tightly until a few tears formed, and I was ready to play the role of the victim.\n\n“Daddy! Nix overturned a bucket of water on me while I was sleeping; I don’t know why he treats me like that for no reason,” I complained and hid a smile that threatened to break my face in half when I saw him frown at Nix who was left with his mouth open when he saw my performance.\n\nTake it, asshole, that’ll teach him not to bother me.\n\nMuahahaha\n\nDad got up from his favorite chair and stood up to his full height, which was quite a lot, and looked between a mixture of irritation and anger at Nix; for a moment, I felt sorry for my brother, but it quickly disappeared as I remembered the rude awakening he had given me.\n\n“Nix, what did I tell you about bothering your sister?” said Dad, but he didn’t let him answer when he was about to do so.\n\n“This is not behavior for an alpha. I will be handing over the pack to you shortly, and I want to feel confident that I am leaving it in capable and mature hands. Do you think you can do it?” he asked, and I knew by the tense look on my brother’s face that he was using the alpha voice.\n\nYou see, I couldn’t feel my father’s alpha voice because I still don’t possess any wolf rank as I haven’t had my first transformation yet, which will be on my 17th birthday, and he will assign me my rank; maybe it will be beta, omega, I have no idea, but then I will be able to find my mate and everything will be a fucking love story... Yay!\n\nWell, it’s not pretty for me.\n\nI’m not looking forward to meeting my mate, at least not soon.\n\nI love my blessed bachelorhood, okay?\n\nA man would ruin all my plans; no thought of a werewolf. What if he’s an alpha? That would be the end of me, no more going out, no more plans to conquer the world, no more fun?\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nI’ll probably end up hanging him or committing suicide, see? Now, that would be poetry in all its splendor; I’m a better poet than Shespier, Shakespeare, or whatever.\n\n“Take a seat; I have something to tell you.”\n\nOh, no, that sounds like a serious conversation or something, I have a bad feeling about that.\n\nDad waited for us to get comfortable on the two sofas in front of him.\n\n“Tomorrow there will be a reunion party at the Dark Moon pack and all the packs in the area have to go with their respective alphas, you two will go with me” He points to Nix “You will attend with the mission to find your mate who will be the future Moon of the pack and you” Now his finger was in my direction “You need to make more friends plus it’s about time”.\n\nHe said this with sadness, he didn’t want me to find him yet either, I was still his puppy, well for both of us, I was like the woman of the house except that I didn’t do any housework.\n\nGod forbid I should do such a thing.\n\nI simply do not wish such a thing... I’m not ready yet... God, don’t let it happen.",

        "content": "POV Megan\n\nDad never found his mate, so his father forced him to marry a female from the pack so that she would have a Luna; for a while, everything was fine; they even loved each other, but his mate found her, and she only had eyes for him, then she decided to abandon her husband and her cubs, At that time I was only a few months old, and dad looked for her even under the rocks, but she never appreciated, for a short time he fell into depression but then he got strength from where he had none to get ahead his children and pack, you can not say that he has not been a great father and a great alpha.\n\n“Tomorrow will be a long day” I muttered as I returned to my bed and surrendered to the arms of Morpheus.\n\nIn the meantime, today, I will dedicate myself exclusively to putting all my sins into practice, starting with laziness.\n\nI’m a genius at planning.\n\nPDV Adam\n\nI was reviewing some documents when my beta and best friend walked in, his name was Josh, and the asshole was wearing a grin from ear to ear, and before I opened my mouth, I knew what he was going to tell me about.\n\n“Alpha, I wanted to tell you that your mother has been looking for you; she wants everything to be perfect for tonight. Apparently, she is hoping to gather a few hearts with the guests,” He said with a smile. “Maybe with your mother’s help, we could find our mates. What do you think?”\n\n“I don’t know friend, hopefully, the packs find their mates, hopefully, you find your mate” I emphasized the latter without naming myself as I had long since given up hope of finding my mate.\n\nMy soul mate\n\nPlease! Two centuries of looking for her and not finding anything exhausts and discourages anyone, I would have to start choosing among the females tonight to be my future wife and Moon of the pack, something that the truth was not so enthusiastic; I want to share my life with the woman who was made for me, the one who will make me feel complete to the core without a doubt.\n\nIt’s too bad you don’t always get what you want, I thought, unable to hide the bitterness that was growing inside me over time, something Josh didn’t overlook.\n\n“Hey, don’t be like that. You’ll see you’ll find her soon,” He said. “I have a good feeling about tonight; you just wait, brother. See you tonight.”\n\nAnd he left, leaving me alone with my thoughts that mostly revolved around “What will she be like? What will she like? What are her aspirations?” and all kinds of questions were going through my mind, but I had no answers for them.\n\nSighing, I got up from my chair and walked out of my office to meet my mother. Vanessa was a woman who, despite the years, the time has not taken its toll on her, and I doubt it will; this was one of the advantages of being a werewolf. I am 335 years old, and my appearance is that of a human in my late 20s, more specifically, 28 years old. I was one of the most feared alpha werewolves in the entire American territory, known for my great ability to lead the Dark Moon pack and my fighting strategies to defend it; my pack was as feared as I was in the territory.\n\nVanessa saw me and came over to hug me, kiss me on the cheek, and then tell me in a reproachful tone:\n\n“Son, why haven’t you enlisted? The packs will be here shortly. Have you prepared your speech yet? Remember you have to find a girl who wants to be our Luna; there are already some rumors in the pack...” This last he said in a low voice, but because of my super” developed werewolf hearing, I heard it perfectly.\n\n“What rumors?” I asked, feeling angry for some reason.\n\n“Don’t be like that, it’s understandable, they’re worried about the pack...” Vanessa began, but I interrupted her.\n\n“What did you hear?” I asked again, frowning at his endless circling.\n\nNo time for games\n\n“Well, they think that your bitterness could cloud your judgment and that you will not give them a Moon this year, like all the previous ones. They want it, and so do you; they want to see their alpha be happy and have heirs; that is something I want too; it is about time you give me grandchildren, Adam,” Mom sighed. “Anyway, They want to see you happy and fulfilled with your wife and children; that’s why I think tonight is a great opportunity for you to start looking for a candidate that you think will fulfill the role, maybe even your mate among them.” He asked me after answering my question\n\n“Sure...” I muttered sarcastically, thinking about what he said to me.\n\nI can’t wait any longer, my pack needs its Moon, I thought contrary to the idea of choosing anyone over my wolf’s wishes.\n\nI went to my room and lay down for a moment on my double bed and looked at the ceiling, exactly at nothing, then I went to the shower to take a bath, when I finished I walked with a towel around my waist to the closet and while I was looking for an outfit for the party I looked at the space I had saved for her, my real partner.\n\nFor God’s sake, I’ve been acting all this time like a child with his first love, pining for our meeting like a ridiculous man in love with someone who might not even have been born yet... Or who I might never meet.\n\nFuck it.\n\nI closed the closet and got dressed in the outfit I had chosen earlier that day, headed towards the door of my room and before leaving my room I stopped.\n\nI think I’ve made up my mind, I thought and sighed, facing my dark fate.",

        "content": "POV Megan\n\nSighing, I closed the door to my room and went downstairs, grimacing as I watched the ruffles on my dress move in time with my steps. I’m not a dress girl; I’m more of a jeans and dad or Nix’s shirt kind of girl.\n\nBut the situation called for it, at least I looked cute, I had to give the dress some credit, I almost didn’t recognize the girl in the mirror in front of me a few minutes ago.\n\nI went downstairs, and my dad and brother were waiting for me in the living room; when they saw me, they smiled and cheered as I made an attempt to walk toward them like a model, noting the sarcasm.\n\n“You look beautiful, baby,” Said Dad\n\n“I do not doubt that you will be the center of attention,” Nix said with a smile.\n\nThen they both became serious and said at the same time.\n\n“Don’t let any boy come near you, understand?”\n\n“Good grief. Of course.” I rolled my eyes as I started to come up with a plan in my head; I knew when I got the slightest chance, I would escape their sights. Hopefully, Kodi would be on site, my best and only friend, who is also a werewolf who has recently achieved the transformation and is the second son of the alpha of the Red Moon pack. My friend is gay, and the only person who knows it is me; Kodi is afraid of anyone else knowing because it could reach the ears of his father, the alpha Mac, and he fears his reaction.\n\nIn a world of macho wolves, I understood their concern perfectly.\n\nPoor Kodi, good thing he’s not alone, at least he has me, I thought and grimaced, I sure wasn’t the best at offering comfort.\n\nWe set off in our Lamborghini and drove to the Dark Moon herd.\n\n“I love this car, it makes me feel like we’re in the Batman gang,” I said looking at the vehicle as if it wasn’t the millionth time I’d ridden in it “Dad’s Batman, I’m Robin and Nix is bat girl.”\n\nNix snorted but kept quiet, I looked over to where my dad was and noticed a small smile forming at the corner of his mouth. I leaned back in my seat as we hit the road and along the way, we sang Chandelier, even though we looked like three” of” tune seals shouting at the top of our lungs until we got to the party.\n\n*****\n\nPOV Megan\n\nWe arrived at the territory of the Dark Moon herd, drove down a dirt road and.\n\nThe forest to the side looked almost terrifying in the moonlight, and I could see several pairs of red and yellow eyes watching us as we passed through the entrance.\n\nThey were surely sentries, wolves that guarded the borders of the pack’s territory for security.\n\nThere were so many cars, all of different models and colors, but every one of them screamed the word “luxury” everywhere, and the mansion was no exception.\n\nNo expense spared here, I thought to myself as Dad parked in a space.\n\n\"Fiuuuuuuu\" hissed Nix,\n\n“They have good taste, don’t you think, Meg?” my father asked me as he admired everything around him.\n\n“Yes, they have it,” I said looking at the house “Good, the sooner we get in the sooner we can leave, let’s go”.\n\nWe walked inside the place, and immediately, the music was playing; in what I assumed was the lounge, there were so many people that the poor waiters were struggling to make their way through with cocktails and drinks, along with some appetizers. Dad was greeted by everyone we came across; he was introducing my brother and me as the future alpha of the Moon Black pack and his beautiful daughter. As for me, there was no lack of assholes to stare at my tits or my ass, some dared to ask me to dance, but I refused, politely dismissing them, and by polite, I mean I gave them my best “I’ll cut your balls off if you piss me off” look.\n\nI spotted Kodi in the crowd and jumped on him without warning, but despite that, he caught me easily, as if I didn’t weigh anything at all, hugging me around the waist and then placing my feet on the floor; I could see how some guests were staring at us.\n\n“Hello beautiful, you look splendid; what mischief have you been up to in my absence?” he asked me with a dazzling smile.\n\nIf you weren’t gay and I didn’t see you as a brother, I would kiss you, Kodi, I thought, and my chest filled with pride; I had my best friend, and he was very handsome.\n\n“Hi handsome, you don’t look bad at all,” I said admiring him, he was wearing a black suit with a matching bow tie, but the jacket he wore in his hand, stayed with the vest, showing his muscular arms which meant he wanted to flirt and see who he fit his teeth to, and speaking of that.....\n\n“And who have you fucked lately? You look quite relaxed and even more rejuvenated...” I said this last with a stinging smile.\n\nKodi blushed, but a silly smile appeared on his face.\n\n“You’re a girl; I can’t tell you who they are and what I do with my conquests Meg; what kind of example would I be to you,” He said, but after a moment of still having the same smile he admitted it, after all, he wouldn’t be Kodi if he didn’t brag to me about his bed flings “Well, last night I got pulled over by the police and that because I had been drinking too much, can you believe that?, so I talked to one of the cops, we flirted and by fucking against the bars I was able to get out without any charges” He whispered in my ear, and his face was priceless, it looked like a ruby from how red it was.",

He looked at me tenderly, and I knew my little act was working.\n\n“My name is Andrew; I’m the alpha of the Howls pack and captain of the state police; it’s nice to meet you, little one,” He said, shaking my hand in a firm.\n\nBut sweet as my smile froze as I listened to his presentation.\n\nShit, this must be the cop who fucked Kodi last night, I thought and concentrated on having a grip just as firm as his as we shook hands as I looked him up and down.\n\nWell, the man was sexy; I understand Kodi now.\n\n“I’m Megan, my father is the alpha of the Moon Black pack, it’s nice to meet you, alpha,” I said as I started back down the same path my friend had left on “I’m afraid I have to go...I must find a friend, but I’ll let you know if I find the boy you described, count me in” I offered him a big, shaky smile.\n\nFor a moment, his eyes flashed, and I was worried that he wouldn’t believe me and find out that my friend was the guy he was looking for, but then he pulled himself together and told me:\n\n“It’s okay, little one; I won’t take any more of your time, but please keep me informed if you know anything; see you.” And he left. I waited until he was out of my sight then I ran like hell in search of Kodi.\n\nI found him in the kitchen, drinking a glass of what I thought was Whisky; he looked worried and was visibly tense, which was really worrying. Kodi was a carefree guy most of the time; this was somehow stirring something inside him.\n\n“Hey, why did you run off like that?” I asked him.\n\nHe looked at me, and for a moment, I thought he wasn’t going to answer me, but he did.\n\n“It’s him, the cop from last night, the one who fucked me and got me out of jail,” He said, depressed and worried. “Apparently, he’s friends with my dad, meaning if he sees me, he can tell him his son is gay, and then I’ll be lost; what if my dad sends the herd after me? I’m dead, Megan,” he said and started to cry.\n\nGod, what do I do? Kodi is my only friend, and I am his only friend; there has to be something that can be done.\n\nJust then, the kitchen door opens, and in walks Andrew, aka the policeman, with a grim face.\n\nOh, how scary, we are going to die and all because of that horny Kodi; I hid behind Kodi, ready to throw him as a weapon if necessary, just to save my neck, okay, I’m just kidding.\n\n“What do you want?” I tell Kodi, hiding from the cop who looks at me with a raised eyebrow, I guess it didn’t take him long to figure out my lie.\n\n“Talk, little one,” Replied the alpha, undeterred by Kodi’s fear. “I just want to talk about what happened last night.”\n\n“So, talk already...” Kodi said, but then he thought better of it, looked at me, and said “Meg, will you leave us alone for a moment? I’ll look for you later” He said to me with affection.\n\n“It’s okay.” I gave him a kiss on the cheek, and out of the corner of my eye, I could see that Andrew was looking at us tenderly.\n\nPeople can get a little melodramatic in earnest, I thought with a grimace. I headed for the door and before opening it I looked at the alpha with narrowed eyes, if before the alpha cop had thought I was tender now he would think twice.\n\n“If you hurt him in any way, threaten him, or touch a single hair of his beautiful hair, I swear there will be no place in this world where you can hide from me, Capisci?” I threatened him without hesitation. “I swear I will have a beautiful coat made from your fur, and if you are equal or bigger than in your human form being a wolf, I might even make me some booties for the winter.”\n\nI did not wait for his response as he left the place and returned to the party.\n\n***\n\nPOV Adam\n\n“Let everyone know I’ll be giving the announcement,” I told my beta, Josh, via telepathy; it was past midnight, and to be honest, I wasn’t in the mood for the party, so I locked myself back in my office, and left everything in Vanessa’s capable hands.",

        "content": "POV Adam\n\nI just wish this would end once and for all.\n\nI left my office and walked to the backyard of the house, passed by a mirror took off my jacket, and adjusted my tie.\n\nIs it getting too hot, or is it just me?\n\nFor some reason, my wolf, Jason, was very uneasy, and as much as I thought about it, I couldn’t figure out why.\n\nI arrived at the podium that someone had left for me.\n\nWhat a great service, I thought wryly.\n\nHere we go.\n\nAll the guests had their eyes on me, different alpha wolves with their escorts. I wasn’t nervous, I gave speeches all the time, but today I felt as if something special was going to happen What could it be? I rolled my eyes; if the fact that I was about to choose any female from among the pack to be our Moon wasn’t enough of an unsettling event, I don’t know what else it could be.\n\nI sighed and continued.\n\n“Good evening, alphas and packs; thank you for accepting the invitation. I hope you are enjoying the party.” They all looked at me attentively; many of the females were smiling and flirting with me, causing me to smile.\n\nI never get tired; I buffet and continue.\n\n“It is my duty and obligation as alpha of the Dark Moon pack to inform you all that I am in search of a mate, the future Moon of my pack. I know many of you are concerned that I may leave you without a stable future or heir to lead the pack, so this is one of the reasons I have invited not only leaders but also females from your packs to be our guide and Moon.”\n\nI noticed that most of the leaders with mates looked at me with sadness and sorrow, and I understood the reason for their looks: I would not be lucky enough to have my Luna as my mate.\n\nOne of them asked me.\n\n“And what happens when I find your mate, alpha?” asked the alpha.\n\n“Good question, Adam, what happens when we find our mate?” I could hear Jason’s words, that was my wolf’s name, as we are the same person, he inhabits practically my every thought and I his.\n\n“Shut up! You didn’t talk to me all day, so don’t do it now,” I replied angrily.\n\n“One of these days, someone is going to take that stick you have buried up your ass,” Jason growled.\n\nGreat, now you’re mad at me too, great, I thought sarcastically.\n\nJust what was missing.\n\n“Well, what I mean is...” The current of a breeze bringing with it the most divine scent floats in my direction, the smell of a torrential rain along with the arrival of spring, an aroma a tinge stinging and sweet at the edges stirs my every sense and reason as a quality sensation spreads through my chest at the clear sign of what that means.\n\n“That’s her, that’s our mate!” shouted Jason in his head.\n\nBy the Goddess, I finally found her...\n\nI scanned the crowd for her.\n\n“Look for her and find her,” Jason demanded in my head, and I could only ignore him as I concentrated on her scent.\n\nI started to make my way through the people who, upon seeing my more wolfish than manly expression, turned away, afraid to cross my path. Jason wanted me to transform so he could look for her, but I just didn’t want to scare her when I did.\n\nThen I stopped and saw her, everyone was silent, she had her back to me, but she turned and saw me, her young and beautiful face had an expression of anger and sadness, then she ran like hell.\n\nBut what the hell... I thought and ran after her halfway. I transformed myself into a wolf to go faster.\n\nNow that I have found you, I will not leave you. I howled with all my strength; adrenaline was running through my veins, and I could only think of one thing.\n\nYou are mine.\n\n***\n\nPOV Megan\n\nWe were all in the courtyard listening to the alpha’s speech...I don’t remember his name; I think it was Alan or Adam, I don’t know; I didn’t pay much attention to him; I was on a mission that seemed impossible, to find a fucking way out of this crowd, not even in my twelve” centimeter heels could I see beyond the shoulders of these people, while the alpha spoke.\n\n“Good evening, alphas and packs, thank you for accepting the invitation, I hope you are enjoying the party.”\n\nBlah blah blah\n\n“It is my duty and obligation as alpha of the Dark Moon pack to inform you all that I am in search of a mate, the future Moon of my pack.”\n\nAnd more blah blah blah.\n\nWho cares about that guy’s love problems?\n\nI heard someone in the audience ask him a question, but I didn’t pay attention.\n\nI couldn’t care less.\n\nBy the Goddess, isn’t there a damn exit here? I thought when I still couldn’t find it, suddenly there was a silence that, in my opinion, was appalling.\n\nAnd now, who died? I thought with sarcasm; I heard people stumbling to give space, but space to whom? I asked myself.\n\nOut of curiosity, I turned around and have you heard that saying, “Curiosity killed the cat?” Well, curiosity killed me instantly without being of any feline species.\n\nAnd there he was, it was that look he had, the same look I had seen in enough people to want to both fear and loathe him, that made me feel so depressed and yet so angry that I ran like hell far away from him.\n\nI have to get away from him.\n\nOh Goddess, I don’t want it; I never wanted it, I thought as I ran with all my might. I could already see my freedom and my false independence going down the drain.\n\nNo, no, no\n\nNO!\n\nI don’t want this. Damn it!\n\nI could hear him behind me; I peeked out of the corner of my eye and saw him transforming into a huge black wolf, his red eyes never taking their eyes off his prey.\n\nThey never failed to see me.\n\nIt’s like a goddamn farmhouse in here, my God.\n\nI wanted to cry, but I swallowed my tears; there would be time for that later. I arrived at a small lagoon that was illuminated by the Moon; from where I was, I could see that it was very deep.",

I wonder if it is out of fear or because they do not want to interfere and just want to watch the show.\n\nThe latter gave me a cynical smile.\n\nIf it wasn’t for me being the star of the show, this would not have even been funny. I saw my father a few feet away; some alpha men were trying to restrain him, as well as my brother and both were looking at me, worried and afraid of my reaction.\n\nSurely they think I’m going to commit suicide; I thought, of course, that will be the end of me if I don’t make it out of this situation, but only",

I can’t allow you to be around her when that happens,” I replied, and my wolf growled, also angry at the pair’s proposal, and then I remembered. “She already had her first menses. Why was she with you at that time? Estrus happens several times a year.”\n\nThe very idea of Megan being touched by another man had me ready to crack a couple of skulls.\n\nI must have shown something on my face because Jerome and Nix’s features turned to absolute rage, b",

And so happy I was with my dream orgasm..... Pfff\n\nI walked towards the door and opened it, and the first thing I saw was skin, skin and Oh!

        "content": "Maxine's POV\n\nIt was the night of the annual moon festival. This was a very auspicious moment for us werewolves.\n\nThe place was buzzing with excitement from every corner. I noticed a few influential people. Powerful and influential Alphas came to this festival.\n\nI couldn't contain my excitement.\n\n\"Tonight,\" I muttered to myself. \"I will awaken my wolf and get chosen as a Luna.\" I felt confident in myself.\n\nAfter all, I was very pretty, and I had a perfect body. So who wouldn't want me as their Luna?\n\nI felt a pulse of energy cursing through the air, it ignited a fervor within me as I stood at the edge of the clearing. I couldn't contain my anticipation.\n\n\"Now, the young wolf should attempt their howl. Should they be successful, their wolves will come to them.\" The person who gave these instructions was a man revered highly in the werewolf community. He is Elder Joseph, one of the oldest and wise werewolves out there.\n\n\"This is it,\" I uttered quietly in excitement. \"The night I embraced my true self.\"\n\nWith a deep breath, I closed my eyes and lifted my head to the sky, ready to unleash the primal howl that laid dormant within me.\n\n\"Here goes nothing!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nI attempted the howl and found nothing but silence greeting me in return.\n\nMy heart sank as the realization washed over me—my wolf remained asleep.\n\n\"Why won't you come out!\" I didn't realize it when I blurted with rage at my wolf for refusing to heed my call.\n\nI am already 18. Some werewolves awaken their wolves by 16. Some are even younger.\n\nMy chest became heavy with disappointment. All my expectations were shattered.\n\nI watched as other werewolves around me awakened their newfound powers.\n\nTheir howls reverberated through the night. Each powerful cry felt like a dagger to my heart.\n\nThe moon reached its zenith, signaling the time for the Alphas to choose their mates. I pushed aside my disappointment.\n\nI hoped to be chosen. \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll be chosen.\"\n\nBut one by one, the Alphas passed by me. They'd spare a single glance devoid of emotions before moving on.\n\nNone of them wanted me. This revelation stung me like a fresh wound.\n\nEven Gerald, the Alpha of our pack and the object of my unspoken affections, was no exception.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Maxine,\" he said, his voice carrying a pinch of pity. \"But I can't mate with someone who can't even awaken their wolf. You're not fit to be by my side.\"\n\nEarlier it was daggers. But now, it is as if a bazooka was aimed and fired at my heart, it is exploding into millions of pieces.\n\n\"I, Alpha Gerald, reject you as my Luna.\"\n\nIn the end, he picked my childhood friend, Rhea, to be his Luna. It's as if the night was meant to torture me mentally and emotionally.\n\nI had a small body. But tonight, I felt smaller than ever. I felt like a rat in the midst of wild cats.\n\nI did my best to contain my tears. But, a single tear still escaped, tracing a path down my cheek.\n\nI turned away, unable to bear the pitying looks that followed me.\n\nAt that moment, I felt utterly alone.\n\nI returned home with a heavy heart. I rushed to my room to drown myself with my tears of pity.\n\nThe weight of the rejection still hung heavy in the air.\n\nI lay awake, my heart heavy with the words that had been spoken, the wounds still ever raw and throbbing.\n\nBut even in the silence of the night, I couldn't escape the harsh reality that awaited me.\n\nMy only family, my father, and Gerald's beta, Harold, sought me out. He gave me a stern look of disappointment.\n\n\"You've brought shame upon our family, Maxine,\" he spat, his voice was laced with venom.\n\n\"I never thought I would live to see the day when my own daughter would fail so miserably.\"\n\n\"Father...\" I wanted to explain myself, but he cut me off.\n\n\"Don't interrupt me, child. I'm not yet done talking.\"\n\nHis words cut me much deeper than any blade. I tried to speak, to defend myself against his accusations, but my lips wouldn't move. I felt suffocated by the weight of his disappointment.\n\n\"I wish you had never been born,\" he whispered. And with that final blow, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone.\n\nI couldn't sleep that night. His words kept replaying in a loop in my head.\n\nThat was the worst night of my life. But little did I know was that the next day would be the worst day of my life.\n\nThe first break of sunlight hit my face. I wiped away the remnants of my tears, steeling myself for whatever fresh hell awaited me.\n\nFather stood in the doorway. He gave me a stern look. It was devoid of any emotion.\n\n\"Come.\"\n\nI didn't know what he wanted, but who was I to disobey my father?\n\nI followed him in silence with a heavy heart, we went outside and boarded his car.\n\nThe ride to the unfamiliar grounds was suffocating.\n\nFather didn't talk throughout the journey. He didn't even spare me a glance. As such, I zipped my lips with the fear of offending him.\n\nWe pulled up to the gates of a grand castle, its presence loomed over us like a silent sentinel.\n\nMy heart hammered against my chest as we stepped out of the car. Father leads the way with a haste stride.\n\nAs we entered the castle, my eyes widened in disbelief at the sight before me.\n\nThe man who stood before us was revered and feared throughout the supernatural world as a ruthless dictator - Alpha Liam.\n\n\"Harold.\"\n\n\"Liam.\"\n\nThe two greeted each other, but the tense atmosphere was enough to tell that they weren't acquaintances, so I assumed us coming here was something akin to a business.\n\nMy father turned to me as his eyes turned cold with no emotions.",

        "content": "Maxine's POV\n\n\"I can't bear the shame of your failure any longer, Maxine,\" he spat. \"I'm giving you away to Alpha Liam. He's the only Alpha who would take someone like you. Perhaps he can instill some semblance of discipline into you.\"\n\nThe words hit me like a physical blow. For a moment, time seemed to freeze.\n\n\"Don't do this, father,\" I begged, \"Please, don't leave me with him. You heard the stories, I promise, next year I'll come up.\"\n\nBut my pleas fell on deaf ears. I clung to him desperately, my fingers digged into his legs as he turned to leave.\n\nThe omegas surrounding us pulled me away. I watched helplessly as my father disappeared into the distance, his figure dwindled until he was nothing more than a distant memory.\n\n***\n\nMy life was never easy. My mother died giving birth to me. My father wanted a son.\n\nHowever, that didn't stop him from giving me a proper upbringing. He hoped I would grow up to inherit his strengths. That wasn't the case.\n\nAnd now, after failing to transform and having no Alpha, he has accepted me, he has finally given up on me.\n\nDespite how much I begged, he turned a blind eye to me.\n\n\"Well, well, well.\" My new owner, Alpha Liam, entered the room. He had his Omegas toss me into a dungeon. No, a dungeon was tidier than this place. I was basically treated like trash.\n\n\"Are you enjoying your new home?\"\n\nMy lips were glued tight as I was overtaken with fear.\n\n\"When I ask you a question, I expect an answer!\" His thunderous voice startled me.\n\n\"Y-yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Good,\" He snapped his fingers. \"That's enough training for now, you can move to a better room.\" Apparently, he's giving me the carrot and stick treatment.\n\nAlpha Liam - People revered him as a powerful dictator who was in love with the thrill of a hunt. Battles where most would consider the option to retreat, he merely viewed them as an opportunity.\n\nWhy would father leave me with a man like him? The Omega's led me to my new room. It wasn't a luxury, but it was a thousand times better than the last one.\n\nThe last time I went through such an embarrassing and dreadful moment was during my childhood.\n\nMy father tortured me when I was just twelve years old. All because I was late for my training session. Since then, I have never been late again.\n\nBut this pain, it cut deeper, it was a pain accompanied by abandonment. It carved a larger wound in my already scarred heart.\n\n\"Give it dinner.\" Alpha Liam ordered his omegas before shutting the door, leaving me to my own misery.\n\nI huddled against the cold walls, tears mingling with the darkness that enveloped me.\n\nHe didn't even refer to me as a person. \"It\", he called me.\n\nI cried, and cried, and cried until I was dried out of tears. I was so tired I didn't realize when I dozed off, not caring to touch the morsel of food that was shoved into the room.\n\nI was treated worse than a prisoner.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes the next morning, a small glimmer of hope flickered in my chest. Maybe everything that had happened so far was just a nightmare, and I would wake up to find myself back in my old life. But as reality set in, I realized that this was my new normal.\n\nThe surrounding silence was deafening, amplifying the emptiness that hung heavy in the air. Time seemed to lose all meaning, disappearing into the abyss of my solitary confinement. All I could feel was despair washing over me like a tidal wave.\n\nI found myself existing in a state of suspended animation, unable to move or think beyond the confines of the cold and sticky ground beneath me. It was as if my world had shrunk down to nothingness, leaving me alone with my thoughts and fears. Despite the overwhelming sense of hopelessness, I knew deep down that I had to keep going. This wasn't the end - it was just a new beginning, and it was up to me to make something out of it.\n\nAs I lay there on the ground, contemplating what lay ahead, I felt a newfound sense of strength rising within me. No matter what obstacles came my way, no matter how dark things might seem at times, I knew that I had what it took to overcome them. With each passing moment, I felt more determined than ever before to rise above this challenge and emerge stronger on the other side.\n\nSo even though despair threatened to consume me whole, I held onto hope with all my might. For as long as there was even a glimmer of light left in this darkness, there was still a chance for me to find my way out and into a brighter future.\n\nI existed in a state of suspended animation, my world was reduced to the confines of the cold, sticky ground beneath me.\n\nI ate cold and stale bread, the bed was hard and rough, and it caused my back to ache.\n\nWith the passing of every moment, I was constantly reminded of my vulnerability in this desolate place.\n\nThe icy tendrils of loneliness wrapped around me, suffocating any semblance of hope or comfort.\n\nEvery heartbeat echoed with the resonance of solitude, a relentless reminder of my isolation. The shadows danced mockingly, casting eerie shapes against the cold walls, taunting me with their silent laughter.\n\nI longed for reprieve, for a glimmer of light to pierce through the suffocating darkness and illuminate the path to salvation.\n\nBut salvation remained elusive, a distant dream shrouded in the impenetrable veil of despair.\n\nThe darkness pressed in on all sides, its oppressive weight-bearing down on me like a suffocating embrace.\n\n\"When will it end?\"\n\nI yearned for the warmth of human connection, for the comforting embrace of companionship, to banish the shadows that lurked in the recesses of my mind.",

At least all the pain will end.\n\nEvery second I spent in the room felt like an eternity.\n\nSuddenly, the large, old door made a loud squeak, and a strong light flooded the space. I had to cover my eyes from the brightness. When I adjusted to the surroundings, I saw Liam.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat as his towering figure moved closer.\n\nHe was so tall that I had to look up. His presence felt overwhelming, filled with emotions I recognized as hate and sickness. Clutching my dress, I fought the urge to cry.\n\n\"I want to make one thing clear to you,\" he approached me. \"You mean nothing to me, Absolutely nothing!\" Each word pierced me, echoing in my head, confusing me.\n\n\"I have many rules for my pack. Everyone must follow them, including you. If you follow these rules, your stay here will be bearable. Who knows, I might even move you to a better room.\" he spoke, his voice deep but smooth. It was cold, but I could listen to it all day.\n\nI didn't say anything. I couldn't trust my voice. Instead, I listened, obeying him like a submissive wolf.\n\n\"First, speak only when spoken to. Second, don't leave your chambers without my permission. Third, only come to my office when called, and never enter my chambers. Fourth, don't leave the castle without my permission. Lastly, you're not allowed to die unless I say so... That's a warning.\"\n\nHis intense hatred made me stare in disbelief. Without hesitation, he turned away, heading to the door. \"W-Why?\" I asked, feeling hurt and broken. \"Why, Liam? My father gave me away to you as a mate, as your Luna.\"\n\nHe stopped, turned back, and in an instant, he was upon me, but not in the way I wanted. His strong grip tightened around my neck, slamming me against the harsh wall.\n\n\"L-L-Liam?\" I choked, unable to breathe, trying to pry his hands off me.\n\n\"Why? Because I simply can,\" his grip tightened, and I gasped for air, tears rolling down my cheeks.\n\n\"Please, you're hurting me,\" I managed to say, looking into his eyes glowing with an eerie light.\n\nReluctantly, he released me, letting me fall to the floor. I clutched my neck, trying to breathe. \"You'll spend the night serving your discipline,\" he said coldly before storming out, leaving me in the dark and cold.\n\nI curled up on the floor, crying. After a while, the door creaked open, and a plate of food was tossed inside. I ate in silence, locked up by my own mate. I slept but was constantly afraid.\n\nMoments later, and the door opened, the person who entered was wearing a maid's uniform.\n\n\"The Alpha wants to see you.\"\n\nShe handed me a beautiful blue dress and informed me that he had summoned me to his chambers.\n\nBefore leaving, she instructed me to clean myself up first. As I made my way to the bathroom, I couldn't help but feel nervous.\n\nI thought he left me here to rot away?\n\nAfter taking a refreshing shower, I slipped into the dress and was amazed at how perfectly it fit me.\n\nIt was almost as if it had been tailored specifically for my body. As I looked at myself in the mirror, I noticed dark circles under my eyes that were evidence of many sleepless nights spent crying.\n\nWith each step, my heart raced faster until we finally arrived at his door. Taking a deep breath, I knocked gently and waited nervously for him to answer.\n\nWhen he did finally open the door, I was struck by his commanding presence and piercing gaze.\n\n\"Come in,\" his voice boomed, commanding and powerful, as he beckoned me into the room. I entered, unsure of what awaited me, and he wasted no time in explaining why he had summoned me.\n\n\"Y-you called for me, sir?\" I stammered, my voice betraying my nervousness.\n\n\"Take off your clothes,\" he ordered, his tone leaving no room for dissent.\n\n\"What?\" I stammered, stunned by his request.\n\n\"Did you just ask my decree?\" His voice grew sharper, his authority palpable in the air.\n\nThe aura surrounding him was suffocating, like a heavy fog that threatened to choke him. I felt my hands tremble as I obeyed his command, reluctantly removing the new dress I had received only moments before.\n\nI didn't wear any underwear, I was completely naked.\n\nAlpha Liam's gaze remained steady, his expression unfazed despite the turmoil swirling within me.\n\nEvery fiber of my being screamed to flee, to escape the intensity of his presence, but fear rooted me to the spot, immobilizing me in his presence.\n\n\"Come here,\" his voice cut through the air, commanding obedience with unwavering authority.\n\nMy legs quivered beneath me as I hesitantly obeyed his summons, my hands instinctively moving to shield my chest, overwhelmed by shame and vulnerability. The weight of his presence bore down on me, suffocating any semblance of defiance.\n\nHe ordered me to turn around, and without hesitation, I complied, the fear gripping my heart intensifying with each passing moment. His commanding presence left no room for hesitation, no space for disobedience.\n\n\"Bend down,\" his voice rang out, firm and unwavering. I trembled at his command, my body obeying out of instinctual fear. With trembling limbs, I lowered myself as instructed, bracing for the inevitable.\n\nAs I bent down, the anticipation of his next move hung heavy in the air, thick with tension and uncertainty. I could feel the weight of his gaze upon me, a silent reminder of his dominance and control.\n\nThe sharp sting of his hand against my buttocks sent shockwaves of pain reverberating through my body. I bit my lip to stifle a cry, the heat of embarrassment flooding my cheeks as I endured his punishment.\n\n\"Get on the bed,\" his words cut through the silence.\n\nThe fear of what was to come left my heart pounding profoundly.",

It sent shivers down my spine. \"Tonight, I am going to devour you whole. Prepare yourself.\"\n\n***\n\nLiam's POV\n\nI have always gotten whatever I wanted.\n\nSince I am absolute, the strongest Alpha there is, why should an Alpha have only one Luna?\n\nThe concept irked me, so I adopted a different approach—I would take a woman and use her as I pleased before discarding her.\n\nIt has become my modus operandi for quite some time now.\n\nAmong all the women I've encountered, I hate to admit it, but Maxine is undeniably stunning.\n\nAs I examined her body, I couldn't deny the truth—she possessed a beauty that would make the goddess of love and beauty, Aphrodite, green with envy.\n\nHer breasts were perfect, well beyond the D-cup, and showed no signs of sagging. Her curves were like those of an hourglass, perfectly proportioned and tantalizingly alluring. Each curve and contour of her body seemed sculpted by a divine hand, radiating an otherworldly allure that was impossible to ignore.\n\nDespite my efforts to remain aloof and detached, I couldn't help but feel drawn to her beauty. It was a magnetic pull that defied reason and logic, tempting me to indulge in desires that I had long suppressed.\n\nAs I gazed upon her, a myriad of conflicting emotions washed over me—desire, longing, and a hint of vulnerability. It was a dangerous combination, one that threatened to unravel the carefully constructed walls around my heart.\n\nYet, even as I acknowledged her physical allure, I knew that beneath the surface lay a woman of substance—a woman with dreams, fears, and desires of her own.\n\nIt was a realization that both intrigued and unsettled me, stirring emotions that I had long since buried.\n\nIn Maxine, I saw not just a beautiful woman, but a challenge—a challenge to my beliefs, my values, and my very sense of self.\n\nIt was a challenge that both terrified and exhilarated me, igniting a spark of curiosity that refused to be extinguished.\n\nAs I stood there, grappling with the tumult of emotions raging within me, I knew that Maxine had awakened something dormant inside me—something primal and untamed.\n\nIt was a reckoning that I could no longer ignore, a reckoning that would forever alter the course of my destiny.\n\n\"You're only allowed to call me sire from now on,\" I said to her after whacking her butt.\n\n\"Yes, sire.\" Her eyes were lifeless now. It was a delicate sight. I took great pleasure in the despair of others.\n\nI could tell that she didn't hesitate to answer with honorifics anymore.\n\n\"I changed my mind, call me master, bitch. Get on your knees.\"\n\nShe gave me a puzzled look.\n\n\"Yes, Master.\" She muttered while on all fours.\n\nShe strode to me. It was a beautiful site. She barked as she reached me. Her head was at the level of my groin.\n\n\"Your master will take good care of you, pet.\" I patted her head.\n\nHer tears amuses me. I never knew witches could cry.\n\n\"Turn around, I ordered her.\"\n\nI grabbed her slender waist and gave her peaches a big spank. Her painful groan was music to my ears.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" I whispered into her ear, my voice barely audible as I gently slid my fingers inside her pleasure hole. \"This room's soundproof. Be free to cry even louder.\"\n\nHer resistance was evident, but my dexterity was undeniable, and she was already wet with anticipation. Despite her attempts to suppress it, I could feel her desire building, her body responding to my touch with an eagerness that belied her attempts at restraint.\n\nWith practiced ease, I pulled down my pants, releasing the sleeping beast that had been longing to conquer our prey. As it emerged, majestic and proud, a mighty 8-incher, I couldn't help but marvel at its power. It shot tall, towering over us like a silent sentinel, its presence commanding attention.\n\nI could sense Maxine's apprehension, her eyes fixed on my adulthood with a mixture of awe and trepidation.\n\nThe sight of it seemed to mesmerize her. For a moment she forgot that she was my slave. Maxine was completely under its spell now.\n\nAs I moved closer, my gaze locked with hers, I could see the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes, mingled with a raw, primal desire. Whether she likes it or not, she can't hide from her pleasures.\n\nIt was a heady combination, fueling the fire of passion that burned within me.\n\nWith a steady hand and a sense of purpose, I guided myself towards her, the anticipation mounting with each passing moment.\n\nOur connection was like a tangible force that bounded us together in a dance of pleasure.\n\nThe world slowly started to fall away, leaving only the two of us lost in a haze of desire and abandon.\n\nAt that moment, nothing else mattered—not the past, not the future—only the intoxicating rush of pleasure that consumed me.\n\nI knew that this was just the beginning—a mere taste of the ecstasy that awaited us.\" Your master is ready to feed you now.\"\n\nMaxine hesitated about touching my beast. If she wasn't going to do it, I'd make it easier for her...\n\nI grabbed her head and shoved the beast deep inside her mouth until her lips touched my balls.\n\nI could feel her throat, she choked as I pulled out a little. \"If you won't do it yourself, I'll do it for you. Choose.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes as she grabbed my dick with both hands. Her fingers moved elegantly. She was truly gifted.\n\n\"That's more like it.\" Maxine's groaning continued. I guess she had a lot of practice doing this with those jocks from college.\n\n\"Faster.\" I ordered.",

        "content": "Liam's POV\n\nHer soft wet tongue accomplished the most here. She slurped all over my rod, missing not even a single spot. I let out a mild groan of my own when she licked around the tip.\n\nI reached my ecstatic point, I was slightly losing my mind, she moved her hands even faster, every motion ended with a slurp and choking sound, but that didn't slow her down a bit.\n\nIf I was any normal guy, I'd have cum by now.\n\nShe kept it up for 15 minutes before I finally blessed her with her new meal.\n\n\"Swallow everything.\"\n\nShe did as she was told.\n\nI took one final picture of her, \"Look at me.\" She raised her head. Her eyes were completely devoid of any emotions.\n\nI have finally broken up with her.\n\nI looked down at her, I was her owner now. She was dripping wet and covered with my semen. I wanted to devour her completely, but not now, I have completed the first step - breaking her.\n\nI tossed her a towel, \"Get dressed and retreat to your chambers. I have training to do.\"\n\n***\n\nAfter I devoured my new plaything, I proceeded with my duties as the alpha. I trained my pack in the gruesome way possible.\n\nI wouldn't have become this powerful if my pack were weak. My strength as an Alpha is tied to their strength.\n\n\"Come at me together!\" I demanded as I was surrounded by dozens of my betas.\n\n\"The first person to land a hit on me will have a wish of theirs granted!\" I knew just how to motivate them.\n\nMy tactics in war are an all-out attack, no mercy.\n\nI smirked when 5 of them charged at me at once. I would have been disappointed if they took turns.\n\n\"Weak.\" I dodged their claws and swatted them away like flies. More surrounded me, but the result was the same.\n\nAfter going at it for nearly an hour, the omegas were all lying on the floor.\n\nSeeing that they were all exhausted, I decided to end the training session then.\n\nExiting the training grounds, I stationed Kris in the hallway outside my office, flanked by Varis, my trusted head officer, and a stylish companion.\n\n\"They're waiting,\" Varis informed me. Stepping out with my Beta and stylish companion trailing, I entered the office to find five senior wolves from the Council seated within. Seating myself with Varis and Kris by my side, I got straight to the point.\n\n\"Why are you here, Elders?\" I skipped pleasantries or extra talk. They had a purpose, and I sensed it.\n\nThe Council elders held high positions, respected among werewolves for their age and wisdom. This Council represented various supernatural beings, ensuring peace and protecting the interests of all kinds.\n\n\"Your tone suggests we're unwelcome, Liam,\" Elder Body remarked. It was no surprise; we rarely saw eye to eye.\n\nWithout hiding my dislike, I met the Elder Body's gaze. Their presence hinted at trouble I wanted no part of. I gave a brief, cold smile. \"Sorry, but I'm short on time.\n\nTell me why you're here.\" Elder Ryu shifted in their seat, considering.\n\n\"Alright, as you wish,\" I replied curtly, not wanting to bend further. \"We've heard you've brought a new mate, Liam,\" an elder began.\n\n\"And you're treating her poorly.\"\n\n\"Just like the last ones.\"\n\nHow did they know that? I'm certain they have spies, those geezers!\n\nThe word \"mate\" hit me hard. My jaw clenched, my hand balled into a fist, tension rising. But I kept a neutral face, watching each Elder closely.\n\n\"We're here to make sure you won't leave her a lifeless carcus like the others. As an influential member of the supernatural world yourself, you should already know why that's important, no?\"\n\n\"My pack's business isn't yours, as long as we follow Council rules,\" I reminded them that they must also follow rules.\n\nThe elderly aren't allowed to interfere in personal pack issues unless it involves an oracle.\n\nDespite their advanced age, the elders had no right to interfere in the affairs of my pack. Their voices reverberated in the chamber, each word weighted with a sense of authority and duty.\n\n\"True, but this matters to us,\" another elder interjected, their tone firm and resolute. \"As elders, we have duties that extend beyond the confines of individual packs.\"\n\nI bristled at their audacity, their unwelcome intrusion into matters that were none of their concern. The urge to dismiss them, to assert my authority as alpha, burned within me like a raging fire.\n\n\"This meeting is over,\" I declared, my voice cutting through the tense atmosphere like a knife. \"You geezers have been warned. Stay out of my business!\"\n\nWith a dismissive gesture, I turned on my heel, fully intending to leave the chamber and put an end to their meddling once and for all.\n\nBut before I could make my escape, their ominous warning hung in the air like a dark cloud, casting a shadow over my resolve. The threat was clear, unmistakable in its implications.\n\n\"If you don't fully accept Maxine as your Luna,\" one of the elders proclaimed, their voice carrying the weight of authority, \"as per the rules, we will declare your pack a rogue pack.\"\n\nThe words landed like a hammer blow, their implications sinking in with a sinking feeling of dread. The elders' ultimatum hung in the air, a stark reminder of the consequences of defiance.\n\nThe decision weighed heavily on my shoulders, the weight of responsibility bearing down on me like a suffocating blanket.\n\nI might be a ruthless Alpha, but I still care about my pack.\n\nI furrowed my brows in confusion, I sat back down and rested a hand on the wooden table.\n\n\"Are you threatening me?\"\n\n\"We're giving you an ultimatum. Announce her as your rightful Luna or become the target of every single werewolf.\"\n\nWith that, they left me to myself. I felt like snapping their necks as I watched them leave.",

Don't forget about the training.\"\n\nShe gazed at me with an unreadable expression. I know she might be wondering why I haven't talked about the baby. But then, She nodded, tears welling up in her eyes. I left the room, my mind a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts and feelings.\n\nAs the days went by, I watched over Maxine, making sure she was well taken care of but from a far distance. Clara continued to perform her duties diligently, but I could see that she didn’t have the same skills and strength that Maxine had. But she was trying. Trying to always make me happy, make me delicious foods. I must confess she's a good cook. But she wasn't so good in bed. I love how willing she was to learn and trust me I was coaching her well.\n\nOne even",

What was my true worth? And how could I possibly show it to a man who seemed determined to break me?\n\n***\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I continued to observe the growing bond between Liam and Clara. She had become so closer to him than any omega in this pack had been. The mansion was abuzz with talk of her, and I felt more isolated than ever. Liam was no longer seeing me or talking to me. He does not even care if I train or not.\n\nI'd had enough. Watching Clara and Liam together every day, seeing the way he treated her with kindness and affection while he had only shown me cruelty, had pushed me to my breaking point. I decided to confront him, to ask him why he had chosen Clara over me, why he had treated me so terribly.\n\nI walked towards his room, each step fueled by anger and",

I refused to let Liam break me completely. I clung to the hope that one day, I might find a way to escape this nightmare.\n\nOne evening, after a particularly brutal training session, I lay on the cold floor of my room, too exhausted to move to the bed. The door creaked open, and I looked up to see Elena standing there, her face was filled with concern.\n\n“Maxine, you have to eat something,” she said softly, holding out a piece of bread.\n\nI took it with trembling hands, my stomach growling in protest. “Thank you,” I whispered, grateful for her kindness.\n\nElena sat beside me, there was sadness in her eyes. “I wish I could do more,” she said. “I hate seeing you like this.”\n\n“I'll survive,” I replied, forcing a weak smile. “I have to.”\n\nDays turned into weeks, and",

He grabbed me roughly by the arm, his grip bruising. \"You dare defy me?\" he hissed, his face inches from mine.\n\nBefore I could respond, he tore my clothes from my body, leaving me exposed and vulnerable. His hands were rough, his actions fueled by anger. He threw me onto the bed and had his way with me, each movement filled with a brutality that left me gasping in pain.\n\nWhen he was done, he shoved me off the bed. \"Get out,\" he spat. \"And expect punishment for your insolence.\"\n\nTears blurred my vision as I scrambled to gather the remnants of my clothes.
